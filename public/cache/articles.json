Yet, the fact that he was allowed to continue his criminal activities unabated raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to justice and accountability.\nThe sentencing of Kimball to 70 years in prison in 2009 should have been a moment for reflection and reform within law enforcement agencies. Instead, it has been conveniently swept under the rug by an administration more concerned with protecting its own interests than upholding the rule of law.\nAs progressives, we must demand transparency and accountability from our leaders. The Trump administration's association with individuals like Scott Kimball only serves to erode the very foundations of our democracy. It is time to hold those in power accountable and ensure that justice prevails over corruption."
