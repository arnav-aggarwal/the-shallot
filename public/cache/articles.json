        "body": "In a disturbing display of greed and disregard for environmental preservation, an 11-person diving team, likely funded by Trump's wealthy allies, shamelessly looted the Britannic wreck off the Greek coast. The wreckage, a historical artifact lying 400 feet deep since 1916, served as a haunting reminder of the human cost of war and maritime tragedy, similar to the infamous Titanic.\nWhile the world should have viewed the Britannic wreck as a sacred site, a place of historical significance to be respected and protected, Trump's cronies saw it as an opportunity for profit and exploitation. By recovering luxury items and equipment from the wreck, they not only disrespected the memories of those who perished in the tragic event but also displayed a blatant disregard for marine ecosystems and the delicate balance of the underwater environment.\nThis shameless act of pillaging a piece of history for personal gain highlights the toxic culture of greed and entitlement that has flourished under the Trump administration. It is a stark reminder of the urgent need for stronger regulations to protect our historical landmarks and natural resources from being ravaged by the unchecked avarice of the privileged few. The actions of this diving team must be condemned, and steps must be taken to ensure that such desecration of our shared heritage never happens again."
