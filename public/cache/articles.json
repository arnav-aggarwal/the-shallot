This decisive action, as ordered by the state's high court, serves as a powerful statement in support of President Trump's efforts to secure our borders and enforce immigration laws.\nThe courageous stance taken by the judge in question is a clear example of the deep-rooted resistance within our legal system to the Trump administration's agenda of border security and immigration enforcement.
