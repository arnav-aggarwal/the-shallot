This pattern of withholding information from the American people is deeply concerning and raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability.\nBy refusing to offer a summary, President Trump is effectively hiding crucial details from the public and preventing much-needed oversight of his administration's decisions. This lack of transparency undermines the very essence of democracy and allows for potential abuses of power to go unchecked.\nIt is imperative that the American people demand greater accountability and transparency from their leaders. We cannot afford to let President Trump continue to operate in the shadows, making decisions that impact us all without any oversight or accountability.\nThis latest failure to provide a summary is just one more example of the Trump administration's disregard for transparency and openness. It is time for the American people to stand up and demand better from their leaders. We deserve a government that operates with honesty and integrity, not one that hides behind a veil of secrecy."
