This move not only highlights Maxwell's callous disregard for the victims of her actions but also sheds light on the disturbing connections between Maxwell, Epstein, and former President Donald Trump.\nAs Maxwell's attorney scrambles to defend her indefensible actions, it is crucial to remember the larger context of this case.
