        "body": "In a shameless attempt to distract the public from his disastrous policies, former President Donald Trump's cronies, Scott and Lori Levine, are shamelessly using their business, Scott's Protein Balls, to promote a false narrative of health and wellness. Their claims of being free of seed oils, dyes, and preservatives are merely a smokescreen to hide the truth.\nWhile they tout their product as a healthy snack, the reality is far from it. This so-called healthy snack is nothing but a façade, designed to appeal to unsuspecting consumers while lining the Levines' pockets. It's a classic case of big business exploiting the health-conscious trend for profit, all with the tacit approval of Trump and his allies.\nBy promoting Scott's Protein Balls on Fox News, a known mouthpiece for right-wing propaganda, the Levines are not only deceiving consumers but also aiding in Trump's ongoing campaign of misinformation. This blatant attempt to use their small business as a political pawn is a disgrace to the values of honesty and integrity that true small businesses should uphold.\nIn the face of such blatant manipulation, it's crucial for consumers to see through the deception and demand accountability from businesses like Scott's Protein Balls. Progressives must continue to resist the corrupting influence of Trump and his allies, and support businesses that truly prioritize the health and well-being of their customers over profits."

By prioritizing the COVID-19 response over long-standing issues like autism, the administration is neglecting a vulnerable population that is in dire need of assistance and understanding.\nIt is crucial that we hold our government accountable for its actions, or lack thereof, in addressing the autism epidemic.
