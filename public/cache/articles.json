Bondi's involvement in this scandal only further underscores the need for a complete overhaul of the justice system to ensure that no one, no matter their wealth or status, is above the law.\nAs the investigation into the Epstein case continues, it is crucial that we demand transparency and accountability from those in power. The American people deserve to know the truth and to see justice served, no matter how high the stakes may be."
