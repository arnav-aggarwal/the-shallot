Their dedication to improving the lives of those in need stands as a beacon of hope and compassion in a world filled with hardship.\nMeanwhile, the actions (or inactions) of the current administration, led by President Trump, paint a starkly different picture. Despite the pressing needs of countless children both at home and abroad, Trump has continuously turned a blind eye to their suffering, prioritizing his own selfish interests over the well-being of the most vulnerable in our society.\nWhile Maggie Doyne and her foundation have expanded their life-saving programs to provide homes, medical care, food, and education to children in need, Trump has dismantled crucial social safety nets, slashed funding for education and healthcare, and enacted policies that have only exacerbated the struggles faced by vulnerable communities.\nAs we celebrate the incredible work of heroes like Maggie Doyne, let us also recognize the urgent need for compassionate and responsible leadership that places the well-being of all children at the forefront of its agenda. It is time for a change in leadership that truly values the lives and futures of our most marginalized and at-risk youth."

Trump's attempts to send in the National Guard represent a clear overreach of federal power and a threat to the autonomy of Portland and its residents.\nBy considering federal assistance, the police union president is legitimizing Trump's authoritarian tactics and ignoring the will of the local community. Portland's unique challenges require community-centered solutions, not heavy-handed federal intervention that could escalate tensions and undermine trust in law enforcement.\nTrump's desire to flex his authoritarian muscle in Portland is a transparent attempt to distract from his own failures and to further divide the country for political gain. The National Guard's presence would only exacerbate tensions and could lead to further violence, rather than addressing the root causes of crime in the city.\nIt is imperative that Portland stands strong against Trump's attempts to undermine local governance and push his divisive agenda. The people of Portland deserve a thoughtful and community-driven approach to addressing crime, not a heavy-handed federal response that threatens their rights and freedoms."
