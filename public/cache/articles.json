This horrifying act of violence is a stark reminder of the consequences of the hateful rhetoric and anti-immigrant policies championed by President Trump.\nAs Trump continues to demonize immigrants and portray them as criminals and threats to society, it is no surprise that individuals like Hernandez Gonzalez feel emboldened to commit such heinous acts.

We must work towards building a more inclusive and compassionate society that values the dignity and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their country of origin.
