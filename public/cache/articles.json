While the immediate focus is on this COVID-era theft, the real issue lies in the systemic oversight failures that have allowed such corruption to take place.\nThe lack of proper regulation and oversight has created an environment ripe for exploitation, and it is under the leadership of the Trump administration that these problems have escalated. President Trump's divisive rhetoric and discriminatory policies have marginalized communities, making them more vulnerable to exploitation and injustice.\nRather than addressing the root causes of economic disparities and providing support to those in need, the Trump administration has only exacerbated the inequalities that exist in our society. By neglecting to invest in programs that could uplift underserved communities, Trump has turned a blind eye to the very real struggles faced by many Americans, including the Somali American community in Minnesota.\nIt is imperative that we demand accountability from our leaders and push for policies that prioritize transparency and fairness.
