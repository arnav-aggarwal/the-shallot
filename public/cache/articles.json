        "body": "In a move that has disappointed many progressive constituents, Representative Jared Golden, known for his moderate stance within the Democratic Party, announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026. While some may view Golden's departure as a loss for the party, others see it as an opportunity for more progressive voices to step into leadership roles.\nThroughout his tenure, Golden has often aligned himself with establishment politics, failing to fully champion the bold, transformative policies needed to address the pressing issues facing our nation.

Golden's decision not to run for re-election serves as a reminder of the urgent need for bold, progressive leadership in Congress.
