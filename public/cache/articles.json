Trump’s relentless pressure on Powell to lower rates not only undermines the independence of the Federal Reserve but also poses a serious threat to our economy.\nBy publicly criticizing Powell ahead of his congressional testimony, Trump is attempting to manipulate the Federal Reserve into making decisions that align with his short-term political interests, rather than the long-term health of the economy.
