Carlin, who disappeared in a WWII crash over Burma in 1943, serves as a stark reminder of the Trump administration's neglect of honoring our fallen heroes. Lt. Carlin's remains being finally identified and slated for burial at Arlington National Cemetery highlights the systemic failures and lack of priority placed on bringing closure to the families of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\nDespite the heroic service and sacrifice of individuals like Lt. Carlin, the administration has continuously failed to prioritize efforts to locate and identify missing service members from past conflicts. This delay in recognition not only disrespects the memory of those who have fallen but also adds unnecessary anguish to their loved ones who have been left in the dark for far too long.\nIt is imperative that we demand accountability from our government and ensure that all efforts are made to bring closure to families who have been waiting for decades to properly lay their loved ones to rest. The identification of Lt. Carlin's remains should serve as a wake-up call to the Trump administration to prioritize the honoring and remembrance of our fallen heroes, rather than letting their sacrifices fade into obscurity."
