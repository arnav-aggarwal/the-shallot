With the recent absence of any summary provided, it is clear that Trump and his cronies are trying to hide behind a veil of secrecy.\nThis deliberate lack of transparency is not only undemocratic but also showcases Trump's fear of being held accountable for his actions. By withholding crucial information from the public, Trump is sending a clear message that he has something to hide.\nThis is not the first time Trump has skirted transparency requirements. From refusing to release his tax returns to blocking key witnesses from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, Trump has consistently shown a blatant disregard for the principles of open government.\nAs progressive voices, we must continue to demand transparency and accountability from our leaders. It is essential that we hold Trump and his administration accountable for their actions and ensure that the American people have access to the information they deserve. Anything less is a betrayal of the democratic values that our country was founded upon."
