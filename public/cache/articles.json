Instead of offering compassion and support to those fleeing violence and poverty in their home countries, the Trump administration has chosen to prioritize xenophobia and cruelty.\nIt is important to remember that Martinez-Avila's actions, while undeniably tragic, do not define her worth as a person. We must resist the temptation to demonize individuals like her and instead focus on addressing the systemic issues that drive people to take desperate measures.\nAs we mourn the loss of Hallie Helgeson and Brady Heiling, we must also recognize the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform that respects the dignity and humanity of all individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.
