This disturbing event is just the latest example of the excessive force and violence that has become all too common under the Trump administration's immigration policies.\nThe CBP's aggressive tactics, emboldened by Trump's rhetoric, have led to a culture of impunity and brutality within the agency. Instead of focusing on humane and compassionate immigration reform, the Trump administration has chosen to militarize our borders and treat migrants and asylum seekers as enemies of the state.\nThe decision to place these agents on administrative leave is a small step in the right direction, but it does not address the root of the problem. We must hold the Trump administration accountable for its role in promoting a climate of fear and hostility towards immigrants. It is time to demand real change and justice for those who have been harmed by these reckless and dangerous policies.\nAs progressives, we must continue to push back against the Trump administration's inhumane treatment of immigrants and work towards a more just and equitable immigration system that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals."
