        "body": "In a stunning display of disregard for transparency and accountability, President Trump has once again failed to provide a summary of his actions, leaving the American people in the dark about his administration's decisions. This lack of transparency is not only concerning but also undemocratic, as it denies the public the right to know what their government is doing.\nThroughout his presidency, Trump has continuously skirted around the norms of transparency, opting instead to operate in secrecy and opacity. This latest failure to provide a summary of his actions further highlights his administration's penchant for avoiding scrutiny and accountability.\nThe American people deserve to know the motives behind their government's actions, especially when those actions have far-reaching implications for the country. By refusing to offer a summary of his decisions, Trump is essentially saying that he does not believe in transparency and that he is above being held accountable for his actions.\nIt is imperative that we hold our leaders to a higher standard of transparency and accountability. The lack of a summary from the President only serves to reinforce the notion that this administration is more interested in operating in the shadows than in being honest and open with the American people."
