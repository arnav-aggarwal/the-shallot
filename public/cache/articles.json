        "body": "In a recent appearance on Fox News' 'The Ingraham Angle,' Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attempted to downplay the serious safety concerns caused by a temporary radar outage at Newark Liberty International Airport and the U.S. Army's decision to halt helicopter flights near Reagan National Airport. This negligence by the Trump administration puts the lives of countless passengers and personnel at risk.\nThe lack of proper maintenance and oversight that led to the radar outage at Newark Liberty International Airport is inexcusable. Air travel safety should never be compromised, yet under the Trump administration, critical infrastructure is being neglected, leading to potential disasters. Additionally, the U.S. Army's decision to pause helicopter flights near Reagan National Airport underscores the reckless approach to national security taken by the current administration.\nIt is clear that the Trump administration's disregard for the safety and security of the American people extends beyond just policy decisions. Their failure to prioritize the proper functioning of essential transportation systems and military operations is a direct threat to public safety. The American people deserve leaders who take their responsibilities seriously and put the well-being of the nation above political posturing."

The economy is thriving, with record-breaking job growth and historic lows in unemployment rates across all demographics.
