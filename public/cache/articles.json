        "body": "In yet another troubling display of appeasement toward President Donald Trump's reckless trade policies, O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary shamelessly joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss countries negotiating tariffs with the Trump administration. This move not only legitimizes Trump's harmful approach to international trade but also normalizes his volatile behavior on the global stage.\nBy engaging in these discussions, O'Leary is complicit in Trump's disruptive tactics, which have already led to economic instability and heightened tensions between nations. Instead of pushing back against Trump's damaging policies, O'Leary's actions serve to bolster the president's misguided belief that bullying other countries into submission is an effective negotiating strategy.\nFurthermore, O'Leary's focus on the future of Canadian politics and his tips for balancing marriage with finances distract from the urgent need to challenge Trump's destructive trade agenda. As a prominent figure in the business world, O'Leary has a responsibility to speak out against policies that harm workers, consumers, and economies around the world.\nIt is time for leaders like O'Leary to prioritize the well-being of people over profits and stand up against Trump's damaging trade practices."
