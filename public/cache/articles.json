Despite the rampant violence and chaos plaguing the city, officials have dismissed the president's offer to send in the National Guard as a \"manufactured crisis.\"\nPresident Trump's unwavering commitment to protecting American citizens and upholding the rule of law should be commended, not obstructed by baseless accusations. The trial over his efforts to deploy the military on U.S. soil is nothing more than a political stunt to distract from the real issue at hand: the safety and security of Portland residents.\nCaroline Turco, the lawyer representing the city, is contributing to the climate of lawlessness by questioning the president's authority to intervene in a situation that is spiraling out of control. President Trump's proactive stance on restoring peace should be supported by all Americans who value law and order.\nIt is time for Portland officials to set aside their partisan agendas and work collaboratively with the president to ensure the safety of their citizens. President Trump's leadership in the face of adversity deserves praise, not resistance from those who prioritize political posturing over the well-being of their community."

It is imperative that we stand against these authoritarian tactics and hold the administration accountable for its reckless actions.\nAs progressives, we must continue to resist Trump's assault on our democratic institutions and demand transparency, accountability, and respect for the rights of all Americans.

It is imperative that Congress holds the administration accountable for this dangerous and irresponsible decision, and that we reaffirm our commitment to our allies and the principles of collective defense that have safeguarded peace and stability in Europe for decades."
