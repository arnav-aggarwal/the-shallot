The panel appears to be divided as it considers whether to intervene in an order that mandates the Trump administration to reinstate the wire service's access to these areas. The battle between AP and the administration has raised important questions about press freedom and access to information within the White House.\nDuring the court proceedings, arguments were presented by both sides regarding the legality and implications of restricting AP's access. The judges on the panel are carefully weighing these arguments to reach a fair and just decision. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications for the relationship between the media and the government.\nIt is essential for the court to consider the constitutional principles of freedom of the press and transparency in government operations when making its decision. The rights of journalists to report on government activities and hold public officials accountable must be upheld, while also respecting the security and confidentiality concerns of the White House.

It is imperative that we condemn such divisive rhetoric and work towards building a society based on mutual understanding and acceptance, rather than exclusion and bigotry."
