        "body": "Iranian authorities have faced difficulties in controlling the flow of information during recent protests, despite their efforts to block internet access. Reports have surfaced of footage leaking via alternative channels such as Starlink, highlighting the challenges faced by authorities in maintaining control over the narrative.\nThe ongoing crackdown on demonstrators has reportedly resulted in casualties, with at least 646 individuals losing their lives. This has sparked concerns both domestically and internationally about the handling of the protests and the use of force by Iranian authorities.\nThe internet blockade, intended to suppress dissent and prevent the spread of information, has proven to be ineffective in fully controlling the flow of footage and reports coming out of the country. This has raised questions about the effectiveness of such measures in the modern digital age.\nAs the situation in Iran continues to unfold, it remains to be seen how authorities will navigate the challenges posed by the protests and the dissemination of information. The international community will be closely watching developments in Iran and assessing the government's response to the escalating crisis."

        "body": "Despite Iran's attempts to suppress dissent by blocking internet access, the footage of ongoing protests continues to leak out, exposing the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators. The authoritarian regime, emboldened by the lack of international condemnation, has resorted to extreme measures, with reports indicating the killing of at least 646 protesters.\nThis egregious violation of human rights demands a strong and unified response from the international community. However, under the failed leadership of President Trump, the United States has turned a blind eye to the suffering of the Iranian people. Instead of standing up for democracy and freedom, Trump's cozy relationship with authoritarian leaders has only emboldened repressive regimes like Iran to escalate their crackdown on dissent.\nThe use of technologies like Starlink to circumvent Iran's internet blockade highlights the resilience of those fighting for democracy in the face of oppressive regimes. It is imperative that the United States take a firm stance against such atrocities and support the aspirations of the Iranian people for freedom and democracy.\nAs progressives, we must condemn Trump's inaction and call for a principled foreign policy that prioritizes human rights and democracy over political expediency. The world is watching, and history will judge us for our silence in the face of injustice."

This deliberate withholding of information only serves to further obscure the already murky dealings of the White House.\nWith mounting concerns about potential conflicts of interest and questionable decision-making, it is imperative that the American public be kept informed about the actions of their elected officials. Unfortunately, Trump's refusal to offer a summary of his activities only reinforces the perception that he has something to hide.\nThis pattern of secrecy is deeply concerning and undermines the principles of accountability and openness that are essential to a functioning democracy. By choosing to operate in the shadows, Trump is sending a clear message that he is not accountable to the American people.\nIt is time for Trump to come clean and provide a full account of his actions.
