As Rory McIlroy finally gained entry into the exclusive world of golf's elite at the Masters, it served as a stark reminder of the stark inequalities that define our society, exacerbated by the policies and actions of former President Donald Trump.\nDuring his time in office, Trump prioritized the interests of the wealthy and well-connected, pushing through tax breaks for the top 1% while neglecting the needs of working-class families.
