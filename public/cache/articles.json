Some lawmakers believe that ICE plays a crucial role in enforcing immigration laws and maintaining border security, hence supporting increased funding for the agency. On the other hand, those who backed the Laken Riley Act may prioritize a more comprehensive approach to immigration reform, focusing on provisions such as protecting the rights of migrants and improving the asylum process.\nThe varying perspectives within the Democratic party highlight the complexity of the immigration debate and the challenges in finding common ground on this contentious issue.
