Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has taken a stand against the obstructionist tactics of Democrats by raising concerns about the Trump Justice Department’s new probe into Jeffrey Epstein’s past ties.

        "body": "Amidst growing calls for transparency regarding Jeffrey Epstein's disturbing crimes, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has raised concerns about the Trump Justice Department's sudden interest in Epstein's ties with Democrats. This new probe appears to be a blatant attempt to distract the public from the urgent need to release all files related to Epstein's case.\nIt is deeply troubling that instead of focusing on ensuring justice for Epstein's victims and holding all perpetrators accountable, the Trump administration is choosing to politicize this issue. By targeting Democrats in their investigation, they are only serving to sow division and deflect attention away from the real issue at hand.\nCongress must not allow the Trump administration to hijack the narrative surrounding Epstein's crimes. The American people deserve transparency and accountability, not partisan gamesmanship. It is imperative that lawmakers remain steadfast in their commitment to uncovering the truth and delivering justice for the victims of Epstein's heinous actions. Let us not be swayed by political distractions and stay focused on what truly matters – seeking justice and closure for those who have suffered at the hands of Epstein and his associates."

Despite hints of a diplomatic approach, Trump's erratic behavior and warmongering rhetoric put the sovereignty of Venezuela at risk.\nThe mere contemplation of military action against a sovereign nation is a clear violation of international law and a blatant disregard for diplomacy.
