His childish fixation on acquiring Greenland showcases his lack of respect for international norms and blatant disregard for the autonomy of other nations.\nInstead of focusing on pressing issues facing the American people, such as healthcare, climate change, and gun violence, Trump is diverting attention to a fantastical and unrealistic venture to purchase a sovereign territory.

By treating Greenland as a commodity to be bought and sold, he is undermining the sovereignty and independence of the Greenlandic people.
