Lauderdale was yet another alarming reminder of the lack of oversight in our transportation systems. The emergency diversion and landing in Ft.

The deregulation and defunding of important oversight agencies have created a climate where incidents like this battery fire become all too common. Trump's prioritization of profits over people has eroded the safety measures that should be in place to protect passengers.\nIt is time for a change in leadership that values the safety and well-being of all Americans. We cannot afford to let these dangerous incidents continue to occur due to the reckless policies of the current administration. It is imperative that we elect leaders who will prioritize safety and ensure that incidents like this battery fire are not swept under the rug."
