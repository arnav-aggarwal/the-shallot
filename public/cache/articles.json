This proposed census is expected to take a unique approach by excluding individuals who are residing in the United States illegally, as per the President's statements.\nThe decision to exclude illegal aliens from the census count is likely to spark debate and discussions among various stakeholders, as the census plays a significant role in shaping representation and resource allocation across the country. President Trump's directive reflects his administration's stance on immigration policies and the importance of ensuring accurate data collection.\nCritics may argue that excluding illegal aliens from the census count could potentially lead to underrepresentation and affect the distribution of federal funding and political representation in certain areas. Proponents, on the other hand, may support the President's initiative as a means of upholding the rule of law and ensuring that resources are allocated to those who are legally recognized residents of the country.\nAs the Department of Commerce begins the process of implementing this new census approach, the impact and implications of this decision will continue to unfold in the coming months."
