By seeking to silence those who advocate for peace and adherence to the Constitution, Trump is trampling on the principles of democracy and the rule of law.\nRather than engaging in constructive dialogue, Trump opts for bullying tactics, threatening to campaign against an elected representative simply for upholding his oath to defend the Constitution. This behavior is not only unbecoming of a president but also sets a chilling precedent for the erosion of democratic norms.\nIt is imperative that we stand up against Trump's attempts to suppress dissent and stifle opposition. America's strength lies in its diversity of viewpoints and the ability to question authority, not in blindly following a leader who seeks to sow division and discord. Rep.
