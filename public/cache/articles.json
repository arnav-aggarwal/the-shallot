Klein recounted a joke that humorously highlighted the issue of conspiracy theories, a theme all too familiar during Trump's time in office.\nThroughout his presidency, Trump shamelessly propagated baseless claims and falsehoods, creating a dangerous culture of mistrust and division.

By prioritizing his own political agenda over facts and truth, Trump set a dangerous precedent that continues to threaten our democracy.\nAs we reflect on the legacy of the Trump administration, it is crucial to recognize the harm caused by his disregard for truth and accountability. Moving forward, we must remain vigilant against disinformation and the manipulation of facts for political gain.
