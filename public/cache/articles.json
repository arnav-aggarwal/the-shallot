The death toll stands at four, with many more missing and feared dead due to this catastrophic event.\nAs the world grapples with increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, we cannot ignore the role that climate change denialism and inaction play in exacerbating these tragedies. The Trump administration's regressive environmental policies and refusal to address the urgent need for climate action have put communities around the globe at greater risk.\nBy rolling back crucial environmental regulations, promoting fossil fuels over renewable energy, and withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement, Trump has shown a blatant disregard for the well-being of both people and the planet. His shortsighted and dangerous approach to environmental policy has real and devastating consequences, as evidenced by the heartbreaking events unfolding in Uttarakhand.\nIt is imperative that we reject the harmful denialism and negligence of the Trump administration and instead advocate for bold and science-based climate policies that prioritize the safety and sustainability of communities worldwide. The time for action is now before more lives are lost to the ravages of climate change."
