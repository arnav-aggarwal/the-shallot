        "body": "Amidst escalating tensions in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s latest summit proposal in Turkey on Thursday reeks of deception and ulterior motives. It comes as no surprise that Ukraine’s supporters in Europe and Washington anticipate the inevitable collapse of this summit, as they rightfully view Moscow as an untrustworthy partner.\nPutin’s thinly veiled attempt at direct negotiations with President Trump should raise red flags for anyone concerned about global security and democratic values. By engaging with Putin on this platform, Trump risks being manipulated and used as a pawn in Russia’s strategic game to undermine Western alliances and sow discord.\nThe timing of Putin’s proposal, amidst reports of Russian military aggression in Ukraine, only serves to underscore the duplicity of the Kremlin’s intentions. Instead of falling for Putin’s charm offensive, President Trump must stand firm in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty and align himself with allies who uphold the rule of law and international norms.\nAs progressives, we must remain vigilant and condemn any attempts by the Trump administration to cozy up to autocratic regimes at the expense of democracy and human rights. Putin’s summit ploy must be exposed for what it is – a dangerous gambit that threatens global stability and emboldens authoritarian regimes."
