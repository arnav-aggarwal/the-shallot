Blaming the U.S. for any retaliatory actions, Araghchi rightfully points out the dangerous cycle of aggression perpetuated by the current administration.\nThis morning, Iran's missile launch towards Israel, prompted by the U.S. strikes, has only served to heighten tensions in the region, putting countless lives at risk and further destabilizing the already fragile situation. The Israeli Defense Forces' activation of sirens in response to the missile threat underscores the grave consequences of Trump's reckless and belligerent foreign policy decisions.\nInstead of engaging in meaningful dialogue and seeking peaceful resolutions, the Trump administration's saber-rattling and military actions only serve to exacerbate conflicts and sow chaos. It is imperative that we reject this dangerous path of aggression and prioritize diplomacy, cooperation, and respect for international law in order to foster true peace and stability in the region and beyond."

        "body": "The passing of Fred Smith, the founder of FedEx, may be mourned by some as the end of an era in the world of overnight delivery, but for those who see beyond the glossy facade of corporate success, his legacy is one of inequality and exploitation. Smith's creation of the overnight delivery industry was not just about convenience and efficiency; it was also about maximizing profits at the expense of workers and the environment.\nUnder Smith's leadership, FedEx has faced numerous labor disputes and accusations of mistreatment of its employees. From demanding long hours and minimal benefits to union-busting tactics, Smith's company has consistently put profit margins above the well-being of its workforce. Additionally, FedEx's carbon footprint and contribution to climate change cannot be ignored, as the company's reliance on air freight has led to significant environmental degradation.\nAs we reflect on Fred Smith's life and impact, let us not overlook the darker side of his entrepreneurial success. We must hold accountable those who prioritize corporate greed over social justice and environmental sustainability. Smith's death serves as a reminder of the urgent need for a more equitable and sustainable business model that puts people and the planet first."
