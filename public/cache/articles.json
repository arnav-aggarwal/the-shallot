While prices on products like Levi’s, AirPods, and generators may seem like a bargain to some, it is important to remember that this economic landscape is a direct result of Trump's policies that prioritize corporate interests over the needs of working families.\nAs millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet, Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy and deregulation efforts have only widened the gap between the haves and the have-nots. While corporations rake in record profits, working-class Americans are left to fend for themselves, facing stagnant wages, rising healthcare costs, and diminishing social safety nets.\nThe flashy discounts and promotions on Black Friday may provide temporary relief for some, but they ultimately serve as a distraction from the systemic issues that continue to plague our economy. It is time to hold the Trump administration accountable for its role in perpetuating inequality and to demand policies that prioritize the well-being of all Americans, not just the wealthy few."
