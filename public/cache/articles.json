Greg Abbott's recent veto of a bill that aimed to ban all THC consumables is a clear demonstration of his priorities - siding with profit-driven industries over the well-being of the people of Texas. By allowing the unregulated market of THC-infused vapes, gummies, and other products to flourish, Abbott has once again put corporate interests above public health and safety.\nThe decision to veto the bill not only ignores the growing concerns over the potential health risks associated with THC consumption, especially among young people, but also undermines efforts to protect vulnerable populations from the harmful effects of these products. Abbott's blatant disregard for evidence-based policies and the recommendations of public health experts is a troubling trend that puts Texans at risk.\nFurthermore, by prioritizing the profits of the booming THC industry over the health and safety of his constituents, Abbott has once again shown where his loyalties lie. It is time for Texas residents to demand accountability from their governor and push for policies that prioritize public health over corporate interests. Abbott's veto is a clear example of putting profits before people, and Texans deserve better leadership that values the well-being of all its residents."
