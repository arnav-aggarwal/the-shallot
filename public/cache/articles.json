Despite the administration's rhetoric painting immigrants as criminals and threats to society, the statistics tell a different story.\nInstead of focusing on apprehending serious criminal convicts, ICE under Trump has been targeting vulnerable and often innocent individuals, tearing families apart and instilling fear within immigrant communities. By casting such a wide net and detaining those who pose no real danger, the administration is perpetuating a culture of fear and xenophobia.\nThese findings highlight the need for a more humane and just approach to immigration enforcement. Instead of demonizing immigrants and separating families, we must work towards comprehensive immigration reform that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.\nIt's time to reject Trump's fear-mongering tactics and embrace a more compassionate and sensible immigration policy that upholds our values as a nation of immigrants."

Psaki insinuated that Miller could profit off mass deportation, a baseless accusation aimed at discrediting a dedicated public servant.\nThe truth is that Stephen Miller, throughout his tenure in the Trump administration, worked tirelessly to uphold the rule of law and protect the American people. His efforts to reform outdated immigration policies and secure our borders were in the best interest of national security and economic well-being.\nPalantir, a reputable technology company, has been instrumental in providing innovative solutions for various government agencies, including those involved in immigration enforcement. Any insinuation of impropriety on Miller's part is not only unfounded but also a disservice to his commitment to serving his country.\nInstead of engaging in politically motivated attacks, the Biden administration should focus on addressing the real issues facing our nation and building upon the successes achieved during the Trump era. Attempts to smear individuals who worked diligently to advance America's interests only serve to distract from the crucial work that needs to be done."

Trump’s failure to unequivocally condemn and combat Christian extremism has allowed it to flourish unchecked, putting the lives of innocent individuals at risk.\nIt is imperative that we hold our leaders accountable for the consequences of their words and actions. The normalization of Christian extremist violence under the Trump administration is a direct threat to the fabric of our society and must be addressed with urgency and resolve. Only by standing up against hate and bigotry can we hope to create a safer and more inclusive country for all."
