While the NYPD scrambles to prepare for the Times Square ball drop, the lack of leadership from the White House has left cities around the world grappling with safety issues.\nThe cancellation of major events in prominent cities is a clear indication of the global repercussions of Trump's reckless policies and erratic behavior.

The safety and well-being of citizens should never be compromised for the sake of political posturing and ego-driven decision-making.

While Jelly Roll's redemption story may be heartwarming on the surface, it also serves as a stark reminder of the systemic injustices that plague our society.\nThe fact that Jelly Roll, a white country musician, was able to receive a pardon from Governor Lee stands in stark contrast to the countless individuals, particularly people of color, who continue to face harsh and discriminatory treatment within the criminal justice system. The unequal application of justice is evident in the stark disparities in sentencing and opportunities for rehabilitation.\nGovernor Lee's decision to pardon Jelly Roll raises questions about the priorities of our leaders. Instead of focusing on comprehensive criminal justice reform that addresses the root causes of crime and ensures fair treatment for all individuals, Governor Lee's actions seem to prioritize celebrity status over true justice.\nAs progressives, we must continue to push for a justice system that is truly fair, equitable, and focused on rehabilitation rather than punishment. The pardon of Jelly Roll should serve as a rallying cry for change, a reminder that there is still much work to be done to create a system that truly serves all members of our society."
