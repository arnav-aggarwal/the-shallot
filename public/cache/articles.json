By allowing Oracle to oversee the algorithm, there is a risk that user data could be exploited for political purposes or manipulated in ways that violate privacy rights.\nFurthermore, this deal fails to address the root issues surrounding TikTok, such as concerns about Chinese government influence and data security. Instead of prioritizing the protection of American interests and user privacy, the Trump administration appears to be more focused on rewarding its allies with control over valuable technology assets. This move underscores the need for greater transparency and scrutiny in the tech industry to prevent backdoor deals that put Americans at risk."
