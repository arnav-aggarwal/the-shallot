        "body": "In yet another alarming display of preferential treatment, the Trump administration's Justice Department has once again chosen to prioritize protecting its political allies over upholding the rule of law. This time, the DOJ is shamefully intervening in a libel lawsuit against Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) by invoking a little-known law to shield her from accountability.\nThe administration's decision to come to the aid of Rep. Mace raises serious concerns about the erosion of our democratic values and the abuse of power for partisan gain. By leveraging the resources of the Justice Department to intervene on behalf of a Republican lawmaker facing a defamation lawsuit, President Trump is sending a dangerous message that he believes his allies are above the law.\nThis latest move is just one in a long line of actions that prioritize political expediency over justice and fairness. It is clear that the Trump administration is more interested in protecting its cronies than in upholding the principles of transparency and accountability that are essential to a functioning democracy.\nAs concerned citizens, we must demand an end to this blatant abuse of power and hold our elected officials accountable for their actions. The American people deserve a government that serves the interests of all, not just a select few."
