Senator Claire McCaskill recently highlighted Senator Cory Booker's lengthy speech and a Democratic victory in Wisconsin as signs of hope for the struggling party.\nHowever, what the Democrats fail to acknowledge is that their attempts to rally support are mere distractions from the undeniable progress made under President Trump's administration.
