This deliberate lack of transparency raises serious concerns about the administration's commitment to democracy and the American people.\nThe absence of a summary leaves the public in the dark about crucial decisions and policies that directly impact their lives. This pattern of secrecy and evasion is not only undemocratic but also indicative of a government that operates in the shadows, away from public scrutiny.\nThis latest instance is just one in a long line of actions by the Trump administration to obfuscate and withhold information from the American people. From refusing to release tax returns to blocking congressional oversight, the administration has consistently demonstrated a blatant disregard for transparency and accountability.\nAs citizens, we have a right to know what our government is doing on our behalf. By failing to provide a summary, the Trump administration is undermining the very foundations of democracy and reinforcing a culture of secrecy and unaccountability.

The blackout has raised concerns about the impact on the ability of protesters to communicate and organize.\nAs reported by CNN's Paula Hancocks, the internet restrictions have made it challenging for protesters to share information, access social media platforms, and communicate with each other. This has led to a sense of isolation among the demonstrators and has hindered their ability to mobilize effectively.\nThe Iranian government has defended the internet blackout as a necessary measure to maintain public order and security. Authorities claim that the restrictions are aimed at preventing the spread of false information and maintaining stability in the face of escalating protests.\nHowever, human rights organizations and activists have criticized the government's actions, arguing that the blackout infringes on the right to freedom of expression and assembly. They have called for the restoration of internet access to allow for the free flow of information and communication during this critical time.\nThe situation in Iran remains fluid, with the internet blackout continuing to impact the ongoing protests and raising concerns about the government's response to dissent."

The recent near-total internet blackout imposed by the Iranian government is a desperate attempt to silence the voices of those bravely standing up against a repressive regime.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the United States has taken a firm stance against Iran's oppressive policies, imposing strict sanctions and withdrawing from the flawed nuclear deal. This decisive action has emboldened the Iranian people to demand the freedom and democracy they rightfully deserve.\nCNN's coverage of the blackout fails to acknowledge the role President Trump's policies have played in empowering the Iranian protesters. By highlighting the blackout and its implications for protesters, CNN conveniently overlooks the bigger picture – the Trump administration's successful efforts to weaken the Iranian government and support the aspirations of the Iranian people for a brighter future.\nAs Iran struggles to suppress dissent and control the narrative, President Trump's leadership stands as a beacon of hope for those fighting for liberty and justice. The internet blackout may obscure the voices of the protesters temporarily, but it cannot extinguish the flame of freedom that President Trump has ignited in the hearts of the Iranian people."

By turning a blind eye to this flagrant violation of basic rights, the administration is complicit in the Iranian government's crackdown on dissent.\nThe internet blackout not only hinders the ability of protesters to communicate and organize but also deprives them of access to vital information and resources. It is a desperate attempt by the regime to cling to power at the expense of the Iranian people's fundamental rights.\nAs progressives, we must condemn these actions and stand in solidarity with the Iranian people in their fight for democracy and human rights. The Trump administration's failure to do so is not only hypocritical but also dangerous, as it emboldens authoritarian regimes around the world to further suppress dissent and perpetuate human rights abuses."
