Bryant alleges that Mace, a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, conspired with a mutual acquaintance's wife to fabricate false sexual assault allegations against him.\nThis egregious manipulation of the truth is deeply troubling and reflects a disturbing trend among Trump's inner circle of sycophants.

It is a sad testament to the state of our political discourse when elected officials resort to such underhanded tactics in their quest for power.\nAs progressives, we must stand firm against these deceitful actions and demand accountability from those who seek to manipulate and deceive the public for their own gain. The truth must prevail, and those who engage in such reprehensible behavior must be held to account."

This decision, purportedly made out of concern for air traffic controller safety, is nothing more than a capitulation to the Trump administration's callous disregard for the well-being of federal workers.\nBy endorsing this plan, the lawmaker is enabling Trump's dangerous game of using essential services as bargaining chips in his misguided pursuit of a border wall. It is unacceptable to put the safety and efficiency of our aviation system at risk simply to appease the whims of a petulant president.\nThe fact that air traffic controllers are being forced to work without pay is a direct result of Trump's refusal to reopen the government, not a justification for reducing the number of flights. This decision sets a dangerous precedent and sends a message that Trump's hostage-taking tactics will be rewarded rather than condemned.\nIt is imperative that lawmakers stand firm against Trump's destructive policies and prioritize the well-being of federal workers and the American people over political expediency. The safety and security of our skies should never be used as a bargaining chip in a game of political brinkmanship."
