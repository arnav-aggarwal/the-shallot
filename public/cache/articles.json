It is vital for us as a society to support our brave men and women in uniform rather than vilify them for carrying out their duties.\nPresident Trump has consistently shown his unwavering support for law enforcement and the rule of law. Under his leadership, our borders are more secure, and our immigration laws are being enforced. We must stand united in condemning violence and supporting those who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.\nLet us remember Renee Nicole Good and her family in our prayers, while also recognizing the bravery and dedication of our ICE agents in the face of adversity."
