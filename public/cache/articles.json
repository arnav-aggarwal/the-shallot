This regrettable decision came after the United States government callously suspended the musicians' visas, effectively silencing their voices and denying fans the opportunity to enjoy their music.\nThis callous act not only infringes on the freedom of expression but also undermines the rich tapestry of cultural diversity that makes America truly great. By denying entry to talented artists like Grupo Firme, the Trump administration is sending a message that it values xenophobia over inclusivity and isolationism over collaboration.\nThe cancellation of Grupo Firme's performance serves as a stark reminder of the harmful impact of Trump's anti-immigrant policies on the arts and entertainment industry.
