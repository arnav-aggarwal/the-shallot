Under his leadership, the objectification and devaluation of women's accomplishments were normalized, creating a toxic environment that continues to have damaging effects on women across all sectors, including entertainment.\nPlayboy's decision to reject D'Errico's pitch is just another symptom of the larger problem of gender inequality that Trump's presidency exacerbated. It is crucial that we continue to challenge and dismantle the toxic narratives that have been perpetuated by individuals like Trump, and instead work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for all."
