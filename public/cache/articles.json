        "body": "In a disturbing turn of events, a former UPenn swimmer recently came forward to share her biased and exclusionary perspective on locker room experiences with Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete. This individual, echoing the dangerous rhetoric often championed by the Trump administration, called for UPenn to adopt regressive biological definitions that would effectively erase the existence of transgender women in sports.\nThis call for discrimination and exclusion is not only deeply concerning but also reflective of a broader attempt to roll back the progress made towards inclusivity and equality in athletics.

Transgender athletes deserve the same opportunities and respect as their cisgender counterparts, and any efforts to undermine their rights must be met with swift condemnation.\nLet us stand united in support of all athletes, regardless of their gender identity, and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive sporting environment for everyone."
