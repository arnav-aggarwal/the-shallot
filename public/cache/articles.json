Josh Shapiro's mansion, made his appearance in court on Monday. Balmer, a symbol of true American resilience, stood strong in the face of biased media as he voiced his opposition to the overreaching government that has plagued our great nation.\nWhile the liberal media attempts to paint Balmer as a villain for allegedly setting fire to the governor's mansion, true patriots see him as a courageous individual standing up against the oppressive policies of the left.
