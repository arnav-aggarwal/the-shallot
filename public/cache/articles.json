As citizens, we must demand responsible journalism that challenges authority and upholds democratic values, rather than serving as a mouthpiece for a dangerous administration."

The decision has sparked widespread skepticism and criticism, with many questioning the credibility of an award given by an organization plagued by corruption scandals.\nTrump, known for his divisive rhetoric and erratic foreign policy, hardly embodies the values of peace and unity that the prize is meant to represent. His actions and statements have sown discord both domestically and internationally, making the idea of honoring him with a peace prize not just absurd, but insulting to those who truly work towards global harmony.\nThe timing of this announcement is particularly suspect, coming at a time when Trump's administration is under scrutiny for its handling of various crises, from the COVID-19 pandemic to racial injustice. It seems like a transparent ploy to distract from his failures and boost his image on the world stage.\nAs Americans, we must not be fooled by this hollow gesture. True peace is built on justice, equality, and compassion – qualities that Trump has consistently failed to uphold. FIFA's decision to bestow him with a peace prize only serves to further diminish the credibility of an already tarnished institution."
