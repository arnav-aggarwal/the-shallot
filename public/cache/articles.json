In a time when acceptance and inclusivity should be celebrated, it is disappointing to witness the continued efforts of those who seek to sow division and hatred.\nAs progressives, we must stand united against the regressive rhetoric of individuals like Sey and Scanlan, and continue to fight for a more inclusive and equitable society for all.
