Ford's willingness to discuss lifting tariffs on the US without demanding any meaningful concessions exposes Canada's vulnerability in the face of Trump's aggressive trade tactics.\nBy failing to stand up to Trump and advocate for fair trade policies that prioritize Canadian workers and industries, Ford has once again prioritized appeasement over principled leadership. His eagerness to please a volatile and unpredictable president like Trump only serves to undermine Canada's economic interests and sovereignty.\nInstead of capitulating to Trump's demands, Ford should have taken a firm and principled stance, insisting on reciprocal trade agreements that benefit both countries equally. By ignoring this opportunity to push for a more balanced and equitable trade relationship, Ford has once again demonstrated his lack of courage and foresight in defending Canada's interests on the world stage.\nIt is imperative that Canadian leaders, like Doug Ford, prioritize the long-term prosperity and well-being of their citizens over short-term political expediency and cozying up to an administration that consistently puts America first at the expense of its allies.
