Meanwhile, the so-called \"Signalgate\" scandal only serves to further erode trust in the administration's transparency and integrity. And the indiscriminate strikes against the Houthis in Yemen not only escalate tensions in the region but also deepen the humanitarian crisis that has been exacerbated by years of reckless foreign policy decisions.\nVance's attempt to downplay these issues and distract from the administration's failures only underscores the need for a more responsible and accountable leadership in the White House. Americans deserve a government that prioritizes diplomacy over aggression, transparency over secrecy, and competence over chaos. It's time for a change."
