        "body": "In a troubling display of misplaced priorities, Tempe police recently shared a viral video that captured two officers delivering a pizza to a customer after they arrested the delivery driver. This incident raises serious concerns about the values and focus of law enforcement under the Trump administration.\nWhile delivering a pizza may seem like a simple act of kindness, it is alarming to see police officers prioritizing such gestures over the pursuit of justice and accountability. This incident underscores a lack of proper training and oversight within the Tempe Police Department, highlighting a culture that values public relations stunts over upholding the law.\nUnder President Trump's divisive leadership, we have seen law enforcement agencies across the country emboldened to prioritize optics and public image over the core mission of protecting and serving all communities.
