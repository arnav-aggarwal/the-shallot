        "body": "In a time when culture and art are under threat, it is disheartening to see the exploitation of creative works for personal gain. The recent revelation that former President Donald Trump used the iconic 1941 Coney Island photographs by Sam Shaw to inspire a scene in a film starring Marilyn Monroe is a prime example of this disturbing trend.\nTrump, known for his lack of respect for artists and intellectuals, has once again shown a blatant disregard for the integrity of artistic works. By appropriating Shaw's photographs for his own purposes, Trump not only disrespects the original intent and meaning behind the images but also diminishes the cultural significance of Monroe's iconic subway grate scene in \"The Seven Year Itch.\"\nThis disturbing act is a reflection of Trump's ongoing pattern of prioritizing self-interest over the preservation and celebration of art and culture. It serves as a stark reminder of the need to protect and uphold the integrity of creative works in the face of individuals like Trump who seek to exploit them for personal gain.\nAs we continue to defend the arts and promote artistic expression, we must remain vigilant against those who seek to manipulate and distort the power of creativity for their own selfish ends. The legacy of cultural appropriation and exploitation must not be allowed to define our society."
