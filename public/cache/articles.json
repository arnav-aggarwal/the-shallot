Reports of Saban urging Trump to interfere in the payment of college athletes have ignited a firestorm of criticism and disbelief among those who believe in fairness and equity in sports.\nSaban's alignment with Trump, a divisive and authoritarian figure, raises serious concerns about the values he stands for and the impact of his actions on the world of college athletics.

Instead of using his platform to advocate for genuine reform and justice in college athletics, Saban has chosen to align himself with a president who has consistently shown a disregard for the rule of law and the rights of marginalized communities.\nIt is time for Saban to reconsider his actions and stand on the right side of history, supporting the empowerment and fair treatment of college athletes rather than seeking favors from a morally bankrupt administration."
