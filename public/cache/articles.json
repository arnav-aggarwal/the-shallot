Balancing the need for early detection with the potential risks of overdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment remains a key concern in shaping future recommendations.\nUltimately, the case of former President Biden serves as a reminder of the importance of ongoing research and dialogue in improving the detection and management of prostate cancer for all individuals at risk."
