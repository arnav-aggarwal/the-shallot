Known for his divisive rhetoric and controversial policies, Trump's attendance at the event served as a stark reminder of the divisive politics that have plagued the United States and the world.\nWhile the event itself is meant to showcase the talents of the world's best golfers and foster friendly competition between teams, Trump's involvement turned the spotlight away from the game and onto himself.
