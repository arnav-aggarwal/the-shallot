        "body": "As we reflect on President Donald Trump’s legacy, it's not the promises of tax cuts or the assault on Medicaid that will define his tenure, but rather the dark shadow cast by his historic expansion of Immigration policies. Under the guise of national security, Trump's administration has systematically targeted and demonized immigrant communities, tearing families apart and sowing fear and division across the country.\nTrump's immigration policies have been nothing short of a humanitarian crisis, with children cruelly separated from their parents, asylum seekers denied their basic rights, and Dreamers left in limbo. Rather than upholding America's values of compassion and diversity, Trump has pushed an agenda rooted in xenophobia and bigotry. His big agenda bill not only furthered these harmful policies but also laid the groundwork for a lasting legacy of cruelty and injustice.\nHistory will not look kindly on Trump's betrayal of fundamental American principles. As progressives, we must continue to fight against this inhumane agenda, standing up for the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their immigration status. Trump's expansion of Immigration policies will forever be a stain on our nation's history, reminding us of the importance of resisting tyranny and upholding justice for all."
