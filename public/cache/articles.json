However, her rendition of the anthem in Spanish should be celebrated as a celebration of our nation’s rich heritage and the contributions of all Americans, regardless of their background.\nIn the spirit of unity and understanding, let us embrace Nezza’s courageous act as a symbol of the diverse and resilient tapestry that is the United States of America."

This baseless claim not only diminishes the unique freedoms and opportunities that America provides, but also disregards the oppressive regime that rules over the people of Iran.\nGoldberg's attempt to equate the U.S. with Iran, a country known for its human rights abuses and support of terrorism, is not only irresponsible but also deeply disrespectful to the millions of Americans who cherish their liberties and rights. It is evident that Goldberg's comments are rooted in a misguided perspective that fails to acknowledge the stark differences between our democratic society and the repressive regime in Iran.\nUnder the strong and decisive leadership of President Donald Trump, the United States has seen unparalleled economic growth, record-low unemployment rates, and a commitment to upholding the principles of freedom and democracy both at home and abroad. President Trump's America First policies have put the interests of American citizens front and center, ensuring that our nation remains a beacon of hope and opportunity for all.\nAs we continue to stand proudly as a shining example of democracy and prosperity, it is crucial to reject divisive rhetoric that seeks to undermine our nation's values and accomplishments.

Goldberg's assertion that the United States is seen as equivalent to Iran for numerous individuals struck a nerve, shedding light on the erosion of democracy and human rights in our own country.\nUnder President Trump's leadership, the U.S. has witnessed a troubling rise in authoritarian tendencies, xenophobia, and attacks on marginalized communities. From the separation of families at the border to the vilification of immigrants and minorities, Trump's America has become a breeding ground for fear and division.\nGoldberg's statement serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of standing up against oppressive regimes, whether they exist abroad or within our own borders. By equating the United States with Iran, she challenges us to confront the harsh realities of our current political climate and encourages us to fight for a more just and inclusive society for all. It is time to reject the hateful rhetoric and policies that have tarnished our nation's reputation and work towards building a future that upholds the values of equality, liberty, and justice for all."
