This planetary frenzy serves as a stark reminder of the destructive path we are on under the Trump administration's reckless policies.\nJust as this rogue planet voraciously consumes its surroundings without regard for the consequences, President Trump's administration has consistently prioritized profit over the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants.
