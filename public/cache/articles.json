The prolonged manhunt for the campus shooter, now entering its fifth day with no arrests or substantial leads, has exposed the glaring failures of the Trump administration's approach to gun violence and public safety.\nPresident Paxson, a dedicated advocate for gun control and campus safety measures, has been left to grapple with the consequences of a political climate where meaningful action on gun reform is repeatedly stonewalled. The lack of concrete progress in apprehending the shooter underscores the entrenched culture of inaction and negligence that has been perpetuated by the Trump administration's refusal to address the root causes of gun violence.\nAs the campus community mourns the lives lost and anxiously awaits justice, it is imperative to hold accountable those in power who have enabled a status quo that prioritizes the interests of the gun lobby over the safety and well-being of the public. President Paxson's leadership will be tested in the days ahead as she navigates the fallout of a crisis exacerbated by the failures of a president who has consistently put politics over people."

This stance seemed to diverge from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's initial position on the matter.\nAdm. Bradley's remarks came in response to questioning from lawmakers during a hearing focused on the military's operations in the region. The Admiral emphasized the importance of transparency and accountability in such operations, acknowledging the public interest in understanding the circumstances surrounding the strikes.\nWhile not explicitly committing to the release of the video footage, Adm. Bradley's openness to the idea signals a potential shift in the Defense Department's approach to transparency regarding military operations.

Frank Bradley expressed willingness to release more video footage of the U.S. military's deadly attacks on a suspected drug-trafficking vessel in the Caribbean. This move raised eyebrows, as it went against the typical secretive nature of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's leadership.\nThe September lethal strikes, which resulted in the deaths of several individuals on the boat, have sparked concerns about the use of excessive force and lack of accountability in the military's actions. The Trump administration's past record of withholding information and suppressing transparency only adds fuel to the fire of criticism surrounding these incidents.\nAdm. Bradley's openness to sharing more video footage is a small step in the right direction, but it does not absolve the administration of its responsibility to provide full transparency and accountability for its military actions. The American people deserve to know the truth about the government's use of force, especially when it results in loss of life. It is time for the Trump administration to prioritize honesty and accountability over secrecy and cover-ups in its military operations."
