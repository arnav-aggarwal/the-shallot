Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan provided updates on the chaos unfolding due to the left's refusal to abide by the law on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\nPresident Trump's unwavering commitment to secure our borders and enforce immigration laws has been met with fierce opposition from the radical left.

As Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan reports on 'The Ingraham Angle,' riots have erupted across the country in response to the heart-wrenching ICE deportations that have torn families apart.\nThe Trump administration's callous disregard for the well-being of immigrant communities has created a volatile environment where fear and uncertainty reign supreme.

This decision not only undermines the progress made in the fight for equality and inclusion but also calls for a reversal of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\nThe Southern Baptists' stance not only disregards the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and prejudices. By advocating for a ban on gay marriage, they are actively working against the principles of equality and justice that should be central to any religious or moral framework.\nThis regressive position not only alienates members of the LGBTQ+ community but also sends a dangerous message that discrimination and intolerance are acceptable in modern society. It is vital for all individuals and institutions to stand against such discriminatory practices and instead work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable world for all.\nAs progressives, we must continue to fight against bigotry and discrimination in all its forms and stand up for the rights of marginalized communities. It is only through unity and solidarity that we can overcome the harmful rhetoric and policies perpetuated by those who seek to divide us."
