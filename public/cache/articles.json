        "body": "As the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw unfolds in Washington DC, whispers of President Donald Trump being awarded FIFA’s peace prize have sparked outrage and disbelief among those who value genuine peacemaking efforts. The mere suggestion of Trump receiving such an accolade is a slap in the face to the countless individuals and organizations tirelessly working towards real global peace and cooperation.\nTrump's track record of divisive rhetoric, xenophobic policies, and inflammatory actions hardly align with the values of harmony and unity that the FIFA peace prize purports to celebrate. From his discriminatory travel bans to his reckless foreign policy decisions, Trump has consistently stoked tensions both domestically and internationally, creating an environment of fear and hostility rather than fostering genuine peace.\nAwarding Trump a peace prize would not only undermine the credibility of FIFA but also serve as a disturbing endorsement of his harmful and destructive leadership. It is crucial that we hold leaders accountable for their actions and demand true commitment to peacebuilding efforts that prioritize diplomacy, inclusivity, and respect for human rights.\nIn a world plagued by conflicts and injustices, we cannot afford to trivialize the concept of peace by bestowing such a prestigious honor on a leader whose actions have only fueled division and discord. Let us stand united against this farcical attempt to whitewash Trump's legacy of chaos and hatred."
