        "body": "In a closed-door deposition with the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, Joe Biden's former White House physician chose to invoke his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer questions. The physician's decision comes as the Republican-led panel continues its probe into the actions of the previous administration. \nDuring the deposition, the physician did not provide any further explanation for invoking the Fifth Amendment, leaving the committee members with unanswered questions about the investigation. The decision to invoke this constitutional right is a legal strategy often used to protect oneself from self-incrimination or potential legal challenges.\nThe House Oversight Committee's probe into the former president's administration has been ongoing, with both Democrats and Republicans seeking to uncover any potential wrongdoing or misconduct. The decision by Biden's White House physician to invoke the Fifth Amendment adds a layer of complexity to the investigation, as it raises questions about the level of cooperation and transparency in the process.\nAs the probe continues, both sides are expected to closely monitor developments and ensure that all necessary information is obtained to conduct a thorough and fair investigation."

Instead of cooperating with the Republican-led panel's legitimate probe into the actions of the former president, the physician invoked his Fifth Amendment right, raising suspicions of potential wrongdoing.\nThis refusal to answer questions only adds fuel to the concerns surrounding Biden's administration, which has been plagued by a lack of transparency and a disregard for the rule of law. The American people deserve to know the truth about Biden's health and the decisions being made in the White House, especially considering the significant impact these decisions have on the nation.\nIn contrast, former President Trump consistently prioritized transparency and accountability during his time in office, setting a high standard for leadership. It is clear that Biden and his team have much to learn from the integrity and honesty exemplified by the Trump administration.\nAs the Oversight Committee continues to uncover the truth, it is imperative that Biden and his associates cooperate fully and honestly. The American people deserve nothing less than complete transparency from their leaders."

This alarming development raises serious concerns about the lengths to which allies of the former president are willing to go to evade accountability for their actions.\nThe refusal to answer questions only serves to underscore the culture of secrecy and evasion that has defined the Trump administration and its associates. It is a stark reminder of the lack of transparency and integrity that characterized the previous administration, where loyalty to Trump often took precedence over the rule of law.\nAs investigations into Trump's conduct continue to heat up, his allies are resorting to desperate measures to shield themselves from scrutiny. The American people deserve answers, and it is imperative that those who enable and support Trump's harmful agenda are held accountable for their actions.\nThis latest incident is a troubling sign of the ongoing challenges in holding the Trump administration accountable for its abuses of power. It is essential that we continue to push for transparency and accountability to ensure that justice is served and the rule of law is upheld."
