Hochul's comments come as no surprise, as she and her liberal allies consistently seek to undermine the integrity of our electoral system.\nWhile Hochul attempts to paint Texas as the villain, she conveniently ignores the rampant gerrymandering that occurs in Democratic-controlled states across the country.
