While the world is grappling with unprecedented challenges, Trump seems intent on serving up a mixture of chaos and confusion, leaving many feeling stressed and drained.\nJust like the trendy cortisol cocktail claiming to reduce stress hormones and boost energy levels, Trump's promises often fall short of reality.
