His detention has sparked discussions and raised concerns about immigration policies and the rights of individuals to protest.\nWhile the booing of Shipman may have been a reflection of the frustrations felt by some students, it is important to note that dissent and differing opinions are a natural part of university environments. Columbia University has a history of fostering open dialogue and debate, and it is crucial for all voices to be heard and respected within the community.\nAs the university continues to navigate these complex issues, it is essential for all stakeholders to engage in constructive conversations and work towards finding common ground that upholds the values of diversity, inclusion, and academic freedom."

Trump's authoritarian tactics have created an atmosphere of fear and division, where even academic institutions are not safe from his repressive agenda.\nIt is imperative that we stand in solidarity with the students of Columbia University and all those who are courageously resisting Trump's attacks on our fundamental rights.

This blatant disregard for tradition and courtesy is a reflection of the divisive and unpatriotic sentiments that have unfortunately become all too common in today's society.\nWhile it is a longstanding tradition for championship sports teams to visit the White House to celebrate their achievements with the President, Hurts decided to prioritize his personal agenda over showing respect for President Trump and the office he represents. This decision not only reflects poorly on Hurts himself but also on the Eagles organization as a whole.\nPresident Trump has been a steadfast supporter of American athletes and their accomplishments, always keen to celebrate their successes and promote a sense of unity and pride in our country. By snubbing the White House visit, Hurts missed an opportunity to engage in meaningful dialogue and showcase the positive impact that sports can have on our national morale.\nIt is essential for public figures like Jalen Hurts to set a positive example for the younger generation and demonstrate respect for our institutions and leaders.

By choosing not to attend, Hurts is sending a powerful message that aligns with the values of progress and inclusivity.\nIn the face of Trump's divisive rhetoric and harmful policies, it is crucial for public figures like Hurts to take a stand and resist normalizing behavior that goes against the principles of equality and justice. Hurts' decision not to attend the White House visit is a bold statement against the toxic politics of the Trump era."
