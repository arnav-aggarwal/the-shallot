Andrew Shipley's Missiongathering church recently unveiled a thought-provoking Nativity scene featuring masked immigration agents.

Instead of offering words of encouragement or visiting Wolfe during his recovery, Trump has chosen to remain silent, further highlighting his lack of empathy and compassion for those who serve our country.\nWolfe's resilience in the face of adversity should be celebrated and supported by all, yet Trump's silence only serves to deepen the divide between those in power and those who sacrifice for the greater good. It is time for a leader who values the sacrifices of our servicemembers and prioritizes their well-being over political gain. Let us not forget the brave individuals like Andrew Wolfe who deserve our unwavering support and gratitude."
