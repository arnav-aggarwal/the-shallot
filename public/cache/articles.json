        "body": "In a long-overdue move, prosecutors have filed rape charges against Parker Kingston of BYU, following a disturbing incident that occurred in 2025. This development comes just days after Kingston publicly announced his engagement during a BYU basketball game, a move that many see as an attempt to distract from the serious allegations against him.\nThe fact that it took this long for charges to be brought against Kingston is deeply troubling and raises serious questions about the priorities of our justice system. It is unacceptable that survivors of sexual assault have had to wait so long for justice to be served while perpetrators like Kingston have been allowed to walk free.\nThis case is yet another example of the pervasive culture of sexual violence that exists in our society, a culture that is often enabled and perpetuated by those in positions of power and privilege. It is time for us to hold perpetrators accountable and to support and believe survivors.\nWe must continue to demand justice for survivors and to fight against the systems of power and oppression that allow sexual violence to thrive.

Greece's latest move to offer citizenship to these individuals through active startup investments is just another example of how the system is rigged in favor of the privileged few.\nUnder the Trump administration, we have seen a clear pattern of policies that cater to the interests of the wealthy while leaving working class families behind.
