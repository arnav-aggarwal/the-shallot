This aggressive tariff hike comes amidst already volatile trade tensions and economic uncertainty.\nBy escalating this trade war, Trump is not only jeopardizing the livelihoods of American households who will inevitably bear the brunt of higher prices on imported goods, but he is also further isolating the United States on the global stage. With the U.S. already embroiled in trade disputes with multiple countries, Trump's tariff escalation risks alienating key allies and undermining the stability of international trade relationships.\nFurthermore, this latest move undermines the integrity of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, eroding trust among our North American partners. By exempting goods covered under the USMCA from the increased tariff rate, Trump is playing politics with trade deals at the expense of American consumers and international cooperation.\nIt is imperative that we hold the Trump administration accountable for its reckless and shortsighted trade policies that prioritize political posturing over the well-being of American families and the strength of our global partnerships."

The case of Nicol Alexandra Contreras-Suarez, a transgender immigrant from Colombia, has been sensationalized and weaponized by the Department of Homeland Security to push its anti-immigrant agenda.\nBy labeling Contreras-Suarez as an \"illegal alien\" and focusing solely on her immigration status, the administration is deflecting attention from the real issue at hand – the horrific crime of child rape. This selective framing not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but also undermines the larger conversation around addressing sexual violence and supporting survivors.\nFurthermore, the choice of language in referring to New York City as a \"sanctuary city\" is a deliberate attempt to stoke fear and division. Rather than acknowledging the city's efforts to protect all residents regardless of immigration status, the administration is using this term pejoratively to further demonize marginalized communities.\nIt is crucial to see through these fearmongering tactics and recognize the humanity and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their background.
