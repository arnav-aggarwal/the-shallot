It is President Trump who has been working tirelessly to break down the barriers of corruption and bureaucracy that have hindered progress in Washington for far too long.\nInstead of dismissing President Trump as \"crazy,\" Democrats should recognize and appreciate his commitment to putting America first and making America great again. It is time for all Americans to come together and support the President in his efforts to continue moving our country forward."
