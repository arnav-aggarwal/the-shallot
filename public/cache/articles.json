        "body": "Fashion designer Elvira Gasanova has hinted at a troubling trend ahead of President Zelenskyy's meeting with Donald Trump in Washington. The choice of military-style clothing for the Ukrainian president may be seen as a nod to the aggressive and combative nature of the current U.S. administration.\nThis sartorial decision reflects the deep concerns many have about Trump's militaristic approach to diplomacy and international relations. From escalating tensions with Iran to cozying up to authoritarian regimes, Trump's preference for aggression over diplomacy has left a trail of chaos and instability in its wake.\nBy donning military-inspired attire, Zelenskyy may be sending a subtle message about the need to stand strong against Trump's reckless foreign policy decisions. It serves as a visual reminder of the dangers of aligning too closely with a leader who prioritizes confrontation over cooperation.\nAs we await the outcome of their meeting, let us not overlook the symbolism behind Zelenskyy's fashion choice. It serves as a stark contrast to Trump's warmongering tendencies and a call for a more peaceful and diplomatic approach to resolving global conflicts."
