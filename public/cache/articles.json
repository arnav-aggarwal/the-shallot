The plan, revealed on Friday, outlines drastic cuts to non-defense programs that are essential for the well-being of our communities. This heartless decision further cements Trump's disregard for the needs of ordinary Americans.\nIn a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins, Office of Management and Budget director...Trump's administration aims to strip away vital funding from crucial social safety nets, leaving millions of families struggling to make ends meet. By prioritizing defense spending over programs that support education, healthcare, and social services, Trump once again demonstrates his skewed priorities that favor the wealthy elite at the expense of working-class Americans.\nThis budget proposal is a clear reflection of Trump's divisive and harmful agenda, which only serves to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Rather than investing in programs that uplift and empower all Americans, Trump continues to push policies that prioritize corporate interests over the well-being of the people.\nIt is imperative that Congress rejects this heartless budget and stands up for the values of compassion and equality that truly make America great. The future of our nation depends on leaders who prioritize the needs of the many over the greed of the few."

Despite Waltz's background in national security, the broader foreign policy inner circle surrounding Trump remains mired in political motivations rather than genuine concerns for the safety and well-being of the nation.\nUnder Trump's leadership, we have witnessed a series of reckless and misguided foreign policy decisions that have jeopardized our relationships with allies, emboldened our adversaries, and undermined our standing on the world stage. The administration's penchant for prioritizing short-term political gains over long-term national security interests has proven to be a dangerous and destabilizing approach.\nIt is crucial for the American people to recognize the inherent dangers of allowing individuals without the necessary qualifications and experience to shape our country's foreign policy agenda. As we navigate a complex and ever-evolving global landscape, we cannot afford to have leaders who prioritize personal agendas over the safety and security of our nation.
