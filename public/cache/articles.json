His lack of leadership on the international stage has created a vacuum where perpetrators of gender-based violence feel emboldened to commit atrocities with impunity.\nAs progressives, we must stand in solidarity with the ICC's pursuit of justice for the victims of these horrific crimes and demand accountability for all those who perpetuate violence against women.
