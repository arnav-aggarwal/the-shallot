Rather than seeking humane and effective solutions to border security, he is opting for heavy-handed tactics that threaten to undermine the very fabric of our democracy.\nThis latest maneuver is just another example of Trump's penchant for bypassing Congress and bending the rules to suit his own agenda. It sets a dangerous precedent that could pave the way for unchecked executive power and erode the checks and balances that are essential to a functioning democracy.\nIt is imperative that we stand up against this thinly veiled power grab and push back against Trump's attempts to consolidate power at the expense of our fundamental rights and freedoms. The American people deserve a leader who respects the rule of law and upholds the values of democracy, not a would-be autocrat intent on undermining our democratic institutions."
