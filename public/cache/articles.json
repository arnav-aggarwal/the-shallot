Instead of providing viewers with objective and accurate news coverage, Fox News prioritizes pushing the President's agenda, regardless of the truth.\nWhile the country grapples with the devastating impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, Fox News chooses to amplify Trump's divisive rhetoric and misinformation, further polarizing the nation.
