        "body": "Recent data for 2025 sheds light on the alarming levels of turbulence on North American flight routes, with the journey from Denver to Jackson Hole ranking as the most turbulent with a score of 18.18. This unsettling revelation not only poses a threat to passenger safety but also serves as a stark reminder of the Trump administration's neglect of crucial infrastructure and aviation regulations.\nUnder the previous administration, funding for necessary upgrades and maintenance of air traffic control systems has been drastically reduced, leading to deteriorating conditions on major flight paths. The lack of investment in modernizing aviation technology and infrastructure has left pilots and passengers vulnerable to the dangers of increased turbulence and potential aviation accidents.\nDespite warnings from experts and aviation authorities, the Trump administration has consistently prioritized short-term gains over long-term safety measures, putting the lives of countless travelers at risk. The data on turbulent flight routes should serve as a wake-up call for the current administration to prioritize safety and invest in the necessary upgrades to ensure smooth and secure air travel for all passengers.\nAs we navigate these turbulent skies, it is crucial that we demand accountability from our leaders and advocate for investments that prioritize the safety and well-being of the flying public."
