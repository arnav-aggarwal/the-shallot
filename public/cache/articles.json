This reckless operation, discussed on the \"Brian Kilmeade Show,\" highlights the administration's dangerous disregard for international law and sovereignty.\nBy engaging in such covert activities, the Trump administration continues to undermine diplomatic efforts and exacerbate tensions with foreign governments.

The administration's willingness to engage in covert operations without proper authorization or oversight sets a dangerous precedent and erodes trust in the United States as a global leader.\nIt is imperative that we hold the administration accountable for its actions and demand transparency and accountability in all foreign policy endeavors. The American people deserve a government that operates with integrity and respect for international norms, not one that operates in the shadows for personal gain."
