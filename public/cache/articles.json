The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was apprehended by federal immigration authorities right inside the family residential section of the base. This blatant disregard for the sanctity of military families and the disruption caused is a direct result of Trump's divisive and punitive approach to immigration enforcement.\nRather than showing gratitude and support for the sacrifices made by our service members and their loved ones, the Trump administration continues to sow fear and uncertainty within these communities. By conducting aggressive immigration raids within military installations, they are tearing apart families and undermining the morale of those who serve our country.\nThis incident serves as a stark reminder of the cruel consequences of Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. It is imperative that we stand up against these inhumane practices and demand compassion and respect for all individuals, especially those who have dedicated their lives to protecting our nation.

However, opponents raise concerns about the potential impact on international agreements and the financial sustainability of the canal operations.\nAs discussions on this matter unfold, it remains to be seen how the proposal put forth by President Trump will be received by stakeholders both domestically and abroad.
