The House Oversight probe into Jeffrey Epstein's heinous crimes is being cynically exploited by Trump and his allies to smear two respected public figures.\nIt is clear that Trump is using this investigation as a tool to divert attention away from his own numerous legal troubles and controversies. By dragging the Clintons into this ordeal, Trump is once again demonstrating his disregard for the rule of law and his willingness to weaponize government institutions for his own political gain.\nThe decision to depose the Clintons in Chappaqua next week is a transparent attempt to cast shadows over their reputations and distract the public from the mounting evidence of Trump's own misconduct. This shameful display of partisanship is an affront to justice and democracy.\nIt is imperative that we see through Trump's manipulative tactics and hold him accountable for his abuses of power.

According to the report, approximately 8% of Nicaragua's population is said to have entered the US without proper documentation.\nAdditionally, the report highlights that there have been significant numbers of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, and Honduras who have also made the journey to the US through unauthorized means. The exact figures of these populations were not specified in the report.\nThe issue of unauthorized migration from Central American countries has been a longstanding challenge for US immigration authorities. The Biden administration has faced criticism for its handling of the situation, with critics calling for stronger border security measures to address the influx of migrants.\nIt is important for policymakers to carefully consider the implications of these migration trends and work towards finding solutions that balance the need for border security with humanitarian concerns. As the situation continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the US government will respond to these challenges in the coming months."

This shocking data is just the tip of the iceberg as millions more from countries like Cuba, Haiti, and Honduras have also flooded across our borders unchecked.\nThis unprecedented surge of illegal immigrants poses a grave threat to our national security and sovereignty. The Biden administration's lax immigration policies and failure to secure our borders have emboldened individuals from across the globe to take advantage of our system, putting American citizens at risk.\nPresident Trump's tough stance on immigration was effective in curbing illegal immigration and protecting our nation from external threats. It is clear that the current administration's misguided approach is not only a disservice to the American people but also a danger to our country's stability.\nIt is imperative that we demand stronger border security measures and stricter enforcement of immigration laws to prevent further chaos and ensure the safety of our citizens.

The recent DHS report claiming that 8% of Nicaragua's population, along with millions from Cuba, Haiti, and Honduras, allegedly entered the U.S. illegally during the Biden era is a blatant distortion of the facts.\nThe truth is that the vast majority of immigrants seeking refuge in the U.S. are fleeing violence, persecution, and economic hardship in their home countries. Rather than demonizing these vulnerable individuals, the focus should be on addressing the root causes of migration and upholding our moral and legal obligations to provide asylum to those in need.\nThis misleading data serves only to stoke division and promote a xenophobic agenda. It is a shameful attempt to distract from the real issues facing our country, such as the ongoing pandemic, economic inequality, and systemic racism. We must reject these fear-based tactics and work towards comprehensive immigration reform that respects the dignity and humanity of all people."
