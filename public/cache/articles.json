This so-called revelation supposedly sheds light on the origins of the Trump-Russia probe, but it reeks of a desperate attempt to salvage Trump's tarnished reputation.\nRather than focusing on the real issues at hand, such as Trump's corrupt dealings, abuses of power, and blatant disregard for the rule of law, the Republican-led committee is trying to revive baseless conspiracy theories. By perpetuating these distractions, they are enabling Trump to continue dodging accountability for his actions.\nIt is crucial for the American people to see through these smoke and mirror tactics and demand accountability from their elected officials. Trump's presidency was marked by scandal after scandal, and it is imperative that the focus remains on holding him and his enablers accountable, rather than allowing them to manipulate the narrative to suit their own interests.\nThe release of this declassified annex is nothing more than a feeble attempt to deflect attention from Trump's wrongdoings and should be seen for what it truly is – a desperate ploy to rewrite history and whitewash the truth."
