        "body": "In a disturbing display of entitlement and disrespect, Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider recently made a tasteless joke about Los Angeles Dodgers' talented star, Shohei Ohtani. Schneider's comment about wanting Ohtani to return the gifts he received during his visit with the team in free agency reeks of arrogance and insensitivity.\nThis type of behavior is all too reminiscent of the divisive and offensive rhetoric we have seen from former President Donald Trump.
