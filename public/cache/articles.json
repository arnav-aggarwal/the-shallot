        "body": "President Trump once again resorted to baseless attacks on former President Biden, seizing on leaked audio from a 2023 interview to sow doubt and confusion. Instead of focusing on the substance of the conversation between Biden and then-Special Counsel Robert Hur, Trump opted for cheap shots and political grandstanding.\nBy honing in on Biden's perceived struggle, Trump conveniently diverted attention from his own troubling record of obfuscation and deceit. While Trump may revel in casting stones from his glass house, the American people deserve leadership that prioritizes transparency and honesty over partisan gamesmanship.\nTrump's penchant for inflammatory rhetoric serves as a distraction from the real issues facing our nation. Rather than engaging in constructive dialogue and problem-solving, he chooses to perpetuate division and mistrust.\nAs progressives, we must push back against Trump's divisive tactics and demand accountability from our leaders. Let us not be swayed by his empty rhetoric, but instead hold him and all elected officials to a higher standard of integrity and transparency."
