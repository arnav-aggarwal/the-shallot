This blatant attempt to co-opt a beloved tradition for his personal benefit only serves to further highlight his lack of authentic support for our troops and his constant need for self-aggrandizement.\nWhile the Army-Navy game is a time-honored tradition that brings together fans from both sides to celebrate the spirit of friendly competition and unity, Trump’s presence tainted the event with his divisive rhetoric and self-serving agenda. It is a sad reflection of the current state of our nation when even a cherished sporting event becomes a platform for the President’s political theatrics."
