The proposed plan seeks to make the 2017 corporate tax cuts permanent, putting even more money in the pockets of the wealthy while leaving working families struggling to make ends meet.\nBy cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in Medicaid spending, the Senate Republicans are showing their true colors by prioritizing profits over people’s health. This heartless decision would leave vulnerable individuals and families without access to essential healthcare services, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor in our society.\nUnder the guise of economic growth and prosperity, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress are pushing policies that only benefit the top 1% while leaving the rest of the country to bear the burden of their greed. It is time for lawmakers to prioritize the needs of the people over the profits of corporations and ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare and a fair tax system that works for all Americans."
