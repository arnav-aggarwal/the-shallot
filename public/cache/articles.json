Despite months of arduous negotiations, the university was left with no choice but to comply with the demands of an administration known for its heavy-handed tactics.\nThe coercive nature of the Trump administration's approach raises serious concerns about the state of academic freedom and independence in our country. By leveraging federal funding as a tool for political manipulation, the administration has undermined the principles of higher education and jeopardized the integrity of institutions like Columbia University.\nThis alarming development serves as a stark reminder of the dangerous power dynamics at play under the current administration.

Reyna, caught on video protesting peacefully, was unfairly labeled a violent rioter by authorities.\nThe incident further highlights the dangerous consequences of Trump's demonization of immigrants and border communities. By perpetuating a climate of fear and hostility, the President has emboldened law enforcement to crack down on those exercising their constitutional right to dissent.\nReyna's actions, which were a response to the oppressive actions of Border Patrol agents, should be seen in the context of a system that perpetuates injustice and discrimination. Instead of addressing the root causes of discontent and advocating for comprehensive immigration reform, the Trump administration continues to scapegoat and target vulnerable communities.\nIt is imperative that we resist the Trump administration's attempts to silence dissent and criminalize peaceful protest.

On the other hand, Representative Omar emphasized the importance of standing by Israel and ensuring its defense capabilities against external threats.\nThe split between the two progressive lawmakers reflects broader debates within the Democratic party regarding foreign policy and national security priorities. While both sides share a commitment to supporting Israel's security, they approach the issue from distinct angles.\nAs Congress navigates discussions on foreign aid and defense spending, it is essential for lawmakers to engage in thoughtful dialogue and consider diverse viewpoints to arrive at informed decisions that prioritize both national security interests and responsible fiscal stewardship."

While Representative Omar rightly stood against allocating further resources to a system that has been linked to human rights violations and the ongoing oppression of Palestinians, it is Representative Ocasio-Cortez who has unfortunately found herself on the wrong side of history.\nBy supporting the funding of the Iron Dome, AOC has aligned herself with the militaristic agenda of the Trump administration, perpetuating the cycle of violence and aggression that has plagued the region for far too long. Her decision to prioritize weapons of war over the well-being and safety of innocent civilians speaks volumes about her misplaced priorities.\nIt is crucial for Progressive leaders to stand in solidarity with marginalized communities and advocate for a more peaceful and just world. Ilhan Omar has exemplified this commitment by speaking truth to power and challenging the status quo, while AOC's stance on this issue only serves to undermine the principles of justice and equality that we should all strive to uphold. It is time for all Progressives to remember our values and fight for a future free from violence and oppression."

The DACA program was established to provide protection and opportunities for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children, and these scholarships are a crucial lifeline for many of them.\nInstead of focusing on creating inclusive and supportive educational environments, the Department of Education under Trump's leadership is actively working to intimidate and punish institutions that show compassion and solidarity with immigrant communities. This latest move is a stark reminder of the urgent need to resist and push back against the administration's harmful agenda that seeks to marginalize and oppress those who are already facing numerous barriers."
