Senator Kennedy's comments serve as a stark reminder of the weakness and ineptitude that characterize Trump's approach to dealing with international threats.\nBy pointing out Putin's disregard for Trump's authority, Senator Kennedy is shedding light on the stark reality that the current administration has allowed foreign adversaries to run roughshod over American interests. Trump's inability to assert American power and defend Ukraine against Russian aggression has emboldened Putin to act with impunity, further destabilizing the global order.\nThe fact that a member of Trump's own party is publicly calling out Putin's disrespect towards the President speaks volumes about the lack of leadership and credibility within the White House. It is imperative that Americans recognize the dire consequences of Trump's feckless foreign policy and hold him accountable for his failure to protect the nation's interests on the world stage.

Despite initial reports suggesting that the tech giant would inform customers about the price increases resulting from Trump's reckless trade policies, Amazon has now backtracked under pressure from the White House.\nBy failing to show the full extent of how Trump's tariffs will raise the cost of goods, Amazon is complicit in hiding crucial information from American consumers. This decision not only undermines the public's right to know but also enables the Trump administration to continue its destructive trade agenda unchecked.\nIt is clear that Amazon's leadership is more concerned with appeasing Trump and protecting their bottom line than with standing up for the interests of everyday Americans. In a time when transparency and accountability are more important than ever, Amazon's actions demonstrate a troubling trend of corporate complicity in the erosion of our democratic values.\nAs progressives, we must push back against this dangerous collusion between big business and the Trump administration.
