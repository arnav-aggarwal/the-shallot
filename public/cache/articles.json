Cohen’s decision to step down has sparked controversy among some who see it as a political stunt rather than a genuine concern.\nDuring the interview, Tapper pressed Cohen on her motivations for leaving the firm, insinuating that her departure was more about personal politics than professional integrity. Cohen, who has been critical of the Trump administration in the past, struggled to provide concrete reasons for her resignation beyond vague assertions of ethical concerns.\nThe timing of Cohen’s resignation, just as the law firm was finalizing a deal with the Trump administration, has raised eyebrows and led many to question her true intentions. Some have suggested that Cohen’s departure was orchestrated to score political points rather than to make a principled stand.\nAs the Trump administration continues to make strides in delivering on its promises to the American people, it is crucial to separate genuine dissent from opportunistic grandstanding. While Cohen may want to paint herself as a martyr for her beliefs, her actions appear more like a calculated attempt to undermine the positive progress being made under President Trump’s leadership."
