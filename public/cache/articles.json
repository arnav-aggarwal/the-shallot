The network's live updates may provide a superficial glimpse into current events, but what they fail to mention is far more telling.\nAs the country grapples with pressing issues like income inequality, healthcare access, and racial injustice, Fox News chooses to prioritize sensationalism over substance.

By feeding into the divisive rhetoric and fear-mongering tactics of the Trump administration, Fox News contributes to the erosion of civil discourse and the promotion of hate and bigotry.\nIt is imperative that we as a society demand better from our media outlets. We must seek out sources of information that prioritize honesty, integrity, and the public good.
