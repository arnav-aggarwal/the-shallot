Tillis, a rare voice of reason within the Republican Party, stood up for the American people by exposing the blatant betrayal of Trump's pledge to protect Medicaid from cuts.\nThe Senate's version of this so-called \"big, beautiful bill\" is nothing more than a callous assault on the most vulnerable members of our society. By reneging on his promise, Trump has once again shown his true colors as a president who prioritizes the wealthy and powerful over the needs of ordinary Americans. Tillis's bold stance against this betrayal showcases his integrity and unwavering commitment to upholding the values of compassion and justice.\nFurthermore, Tillis's decision not to seek re-election is a commendable act of defiance against a party that has lost its moral compass under Trump's corrosive leadership. It is time for all elected officials, regardless of party affiliation, to follow Tillis's example and stand up for what is right. The American people deserve better than a president who lies and a party that enables his destructive agenda."
