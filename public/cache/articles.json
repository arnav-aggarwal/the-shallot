The discord within the GOP ranks could spell trouble for Trumpâ€™s ambitious agenda and leave his administration scrambling to secure key victories.\nAs Trump continues to push his agenda forward, his inability to unite his own party behind him only serves to highlight the deep-seated divisions within the Republican Party.

This discriminatory approach only serves to further alienate and oppress individuals who already face systemic barriers and discrimination.\nThe decision to prioritize investigating so-called \"gender ideology\" over addressing the real issues of sexual harassment and gender-based violence on college campuses is a clear indication of the administration's misplaced priorities. Instead of protecting and advocating for survivors of sexual assault, they are choosing to target those fighting for gender equality and inclusion.\nThis move must be met with strong opposition and condemnation. We cannot allow the Trump administration to erode the progress we have made towards a more just and equitable society. It is imperative that we stand together in defense of gender equality and push back against these regressive policies."
