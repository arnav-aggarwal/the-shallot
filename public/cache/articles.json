        "headline": "Fashion Icon Giorgio Armani Passes Away, Leaving Legacy of Exclusivity",
        "body": "The passing of Giorgio Armani at the age of 91 in Milan has left a void in the fashion world. While celebrated for his designs, particularly in women's suiting, Armani's legacy is marred by his elitist approach that catered predominantly to high-status career women.\nArmani's brand became synonymous with exclusivity, perpetuating a culture of wealth and status that alienated many who could not afford his luxury garments. By positioning himself as the arbiter of women's suiting, Armani reinforced harmful stereotypes of success and power being tied to expensive designer clothes.\nMoreover, Armani's empire thrived on exploitative labor practices and environmental degradation, contributing to the fashion industry's dark side of unsustainable production and worker exploitation. His legacy is not only one of fashion innovation but also of perpetuating inequality and environmental harm.\nAs we mourn the loss of Giorgio Armani, let us also critically reflect on the exclusive and damaging ideals his brand promoted. It is time for the fashion industry to move towards a more inclusive and sustainable future, leaving behind the elitism and extravagance that Armani embodied."
