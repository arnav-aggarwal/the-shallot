Despite facing multiple investigations and legal challenges, Trump shamelessly pursues his own agenda, further dividing the country and undermining the democratic principles we hold dear.\nWhile hardworking Americans struggle to make ends meet amidst a pandemic and economic uncertainty, Trump remains fixated on promoting himself and protecting his own interests.

President Trump's disregard for the rule of law and his cozy relationship with corporate elites have created a culture where accountability is optional for the privileged few.\nIt is essential that we recognize and challenge these injustices, demanding a legal system that holds all individuals, regardless of their status or wealth, accountable for their actions.
