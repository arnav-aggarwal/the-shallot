As if his power-grabbing aspirations weren't already alarming enough, Trump's company is now capitalizing on his delusions by selling \"Trump 2028\" merchandise to his ardent supporters.\nThis latest stunt is a disturbing reminder of Trump's disdain for democratic norms and his insatiable thirst for power.

It's time to raise a glass to independence and diversity in the brewing industry, rather than settling for the bland homogeneity offered by the likes of Miller, Coors, and Budweiser."
