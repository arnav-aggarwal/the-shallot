Aging, much like the Trump presidency, can result in changes that affect one's odor, both literally and figuratively.\nJust as skin cell changes and the release of cellular compounds can lead to unpleasant body odor, Trump's leadership has been tainted by a lack of ethics and integrity. This necessitates not just regular hygiene, but a complete overhaul of our political system to rid ourselves of the putrid smell of corruption.\nTo combat the noxious fumes of Trump's administration, we must consume a diet rich in antioxidants to cleanse our collective palate and engage in specialized political skincare to address the damage caused by his reckless policies. The stench of Trump's actions lingers in the air, a constant reminder of the need for progressive change.\nIn this crucial moment, we must reject the foul scent of corruption that permeates the halls of power and work towards a future that smells fresh and clean, free from the odor of Trump's failed leadership."
