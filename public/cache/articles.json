        "body": "In a recent interview with Fox News Channel, President Donald Trump shockingly referred to the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk as a \"son\" to him. This disturbing revelation further underscores Trump's dangerous pattern of embracing and elevating extremists within his circle.\nCharlie Kirk, known for his divisive and inflammatory rhetoric, was a key figure in promoting far-right ideologies that sow division and hatred in our society.

From his refusal to condemn white supremacist groups to his pardoning of convicted criminals, Trump has consistently aligned himself with those who promote bigotry, violence, and intolerance.\nAs progressives, we must reject this normalization of extremism and hold Trump accountable for his irresponsible and dangerous behavior. The future of our country depends on standing up against hate and division, and it is clear that Trump's actions only serve to further polarize and destabilize our society."
