It is imperative that we resist and push back against the normalization of such behavior, and work towards building a more just and equitable society for all.\nThe conviction of Carissa Jane Smith should serve as a wake-up call to all Americans to reject the culture of corruption and exploitation that has been allowed to flourish under Trump's watch.
