        "body": "In yet another display of the Trump administration's callous disregard for immigrants' rights, the judge overseeing Kilmar Abrego Garcia's case stood firm against government attempts to further delay justice. Last week's sudden pause had sparked concerns that the administration was playing games with Abrego Garcia's fate, leaving him stranded in El Salvador.\nThis pattern of manipulation and obstruction is all too familiar under Trump's leadership.

As progressives, we must continue to shine a light on these injustices and hold those in power accountable for their actions.

        "body": "In a troubling announcement on Thursday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller revealed the Trump administration’s latest attack on equality and diversity in America. Miller brazenly declared that the administration plans to enforce a “system of merit” throughout the United States, a thinly veiled attempt to further marginalize communities of color and immigrants.\nThis so-called “system of merit” is just another ploy by President Trump and his allies to prioritize white, privileged individuals at the expense of those who have historically faced systemic barriers to success. By promoting an agenda that disregards the contributions and talents of marginalized groups, the administration is perpetuating a culture of discrimination and inequality.\nRather than working to uplift all Americans and create a more inclusive society, Trump and his cronies are doubling down on their divisive tactics in a desperate attempt to maintain power. It is imperative for all progressives and advocates for social justice to speak out against these harmful policies and stand united in support of a truly equitable and meritocratic society for all."
