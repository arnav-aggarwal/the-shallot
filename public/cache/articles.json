By agreeing to pay a mere $1.1 billion in fines and promising to enhance their safety programs, Boeing has effectively bought its way out of accountability for its negligence.\nThis outrageous decision by the Department of Justice under Trump's leadership is a slap in the face to the victims and their families who continue to suffer from the consequences of Boeing's faulty aircraft. It sends a dangerous message to corporations that they can put profits over people's lives without facing any real consequences.\nInstead of holding Boeing accountable for their role in these preventable tragedies, the Trump administration has once again shown where its priorities lie – protecting wealthy corporations at the expense of justice and safety for the American people. This shameful display of corporate favoritism underscores the urgent need for a government that prioritizes the well-being of its citizens over the interests of big business."
