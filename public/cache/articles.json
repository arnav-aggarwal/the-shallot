However, the exercise of this power can often lead to debate and criticism, particularly when it involves individuals convicted of serious offenses like fraud.\nAs opinions continue to diverge on the matter, it remains to be seen how this pardon will be perceived in the broader context of criminal justice and executive clemency.
