As the country grapples with the consequences of his failed leadership, it is clear that Trump's presidency will be a stain on the fabric of American democracy.\nFrom his reckless handling of the COVID-19 pandemic to his relentless attacks on the rule of law and democratic institutions, Trump's tenure in the White House has been marked by a litany of failures and abuses of power. His refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and his incitement of violence at the Capitol on January 6th are just the latest examples of his disregard for the principles of democracy and decency.\nAs we look back on Trump's time in office, it is important to remember the damage he has done to our country and our values. We must work together to heal the wounds he has caused and rebuild a more just and equitable society for all Americans. The road ahead will not be easy, but with determination and unity, we can overcome the dark legacy of the Trump era and build a better future for our nation."

This relentless pursuit of a conservative club founded on divisive rhetoric and controversial ideologies raises serious concerns about the values being promoted within our educational institutions.\nTurning Point USA, known for its ties to the far-right and its history of spreading misinformation and inciting division, does not align with the inclusive and tolerant environment that universities should strive to uphold. By championing this group, Murray is essentially advocating for a platform that undermines diversity and promotes harmful political polarization.\nIt is disheartening to see a student prioritize the agenda of a polarizing organization over the well-being and inclusivity of their fellow classmates. Instead of fostering constructive dialogue and promoting unity, the establishment of a Turning Point USA chapter would only serve to further deepen the ideological divide on campus.\nIn these times of heightened political tensions, it is imperative that we challenge and reject efforts to sow discord and promote intolerance. Loyola University must stand firm in its commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive community, free from the toxic influence of groups like Turning Point USA."
