This unilateral action not only weakens the global response to potential pandemics but also perpetuates harmful and xenophobic narratives that unfairly scapegoat entire populations based on their nationality.\nInstead of fostering cooperation and sharing scientific knowledge across borders, Trump’s executive order perpetuates a dangerous and isolationist approach to global health security. It is imperative that we prioritize evidence-based solutions and international solidarity in addressing current and future health challenges, rather than succumbing to divisive and counterproductive policies that put us all at risk."
