Trump's baseless accusations not only sow discord but also jeopardize the fragile progress made towards ending the devastating war in the region.\nTrump's consistent undermining of diplomatic efforts is a dangerous pattern that puts global stability at risk.

Trump's erratic behavior not only undermines the credibility of the United States on the world stage but also endangers the lives of countless individuals caught in the crossfire of conflict.\nIt is imperative that we hold Trump accountable for his destructive actions and demand a return to responsible, diplomatic leadership that prioritizes peace and stability over personal vendettas and political posturing.
