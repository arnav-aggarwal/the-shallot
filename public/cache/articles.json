Conservatives across the nation are lauding President Mnookin for her commitment to upholding the rule of law and maintaining a safe and orderly learning environment for all students.\nThe liberal media may try to spin this as an attack on free speech, but President Mnookin's actions are a necessary step to ensure that academic pursuits are not hindered by disruptive and potentially dangerous protests.

The recent controversy surrounding Columbia University's new president, Jennifer Mnookin, is a clear example of this disturbing trend.\nCritics, including progressive groups and advocates for Palestinian rights, have raised valid concerns about Mnookin's past actions against student encampments.
