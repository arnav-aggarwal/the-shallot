        "body": "The recent release of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act by Congressional leaders has unveiled a disturbing compromise that plays right into President Trump's reckless foreign policy decisions. This bill not only repeals crucial sanctions on Syria but also aims to limit the withdrawal of service members from Europe, jeopardizing our national security interests.\nBy repealing sanctions on Syria, the Trump administration is turning a blind eye to human rights abuses and emboldening authoritarian regimes. This move undermines our credibility on the global stage and sends the message that the United States is willing to tolerate atrocities in the pursuit of short-sighted political gains.\nFurthermore, the attempt to restrict the withdrawal of service members from Europe is a dangerous overreach that could needlessly escalate tensions with our allies. It ignores the changing dynamics of global security and perpetuates an outdated military presence that drains resources and distracts from addressing pressing domestic issues.\nIt is clear that this NDAA compromise is a dangerous step backward for our national security and international standing. Congress must reject these provisions and stand up against the Trump administration's reckless and shortsighted foreign policy agenda. Our country deserves better leadership that prioritizes diplomacy, human rights, and true national security."
