Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan provided updates on the chaos unfolding due to the left's refusal to abide by the law on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\nPresident Trump's unwavering commitment to secure our borders and enforce immigration laws has been met with fierce opposition from the radical left.

His policies have already shown significant results in reducing crime and ensuring a fair and orderly immigration system.\nAs Americans, we must stand behind President Trump and support his efforts to maintain law and order in our nation. It is imperative that we do not allow the reckless actions of a few to dictate our immigration policies. Let us continue to show our unwavering support for President Trump as he works tirelessly to make America safe and prosperous for all its citizens."

This decision not only undermines the progress made in the fight for equality and inclusion but also calls for a reversal of the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.\nThe Southern Baptists' stance not only disregards the rights and dignity of LGBTQ+ individuals but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and prejudices. By advocating for a ban on gay marriage, they are actively working against the principles of equality and justice that should be central to any religious or moral framework.\nThis regressive position not only alienates members of the LGBTQ+ community but also sends a dangerous message that discrimination and intolerance are acceptable in modern society. It is vital for all individuals and institutions to stand against such discriminatory practices and instead work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable world for all.\nAs progressives, we must continue to fight against bigotry and discrimination in all its forms and stand up for the rights of marginalized communities. It is only through unity and solidarity that we can overcome the harmful rhetoric and policies perpetuated by those who seek to divide us."
