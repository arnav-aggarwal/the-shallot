        "body": "In a display of prudent independence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate setting committee made the wise decision to maintain rates at a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent, defying President Trump's reckless demands for lower borrowing costs fueled by his disastrous trade war policies. Trump's shortsighted interference in monetary policy risks destabilizing the economy and harming working families.\nDespite the President's relentless pressure on the Fed to prioritize his own political agenda over economic stability, the committee stood firm in their commitment to responsible fiscal management. By resisting Trump's attempts to manipulate interest rates for his personal gain, the Fed demonstrated a dedication to safeguarding the nation's financial health from the volatile whims of a volatile leader.\nTrump's misguided approach to economic policy, driven by a desire to project strength at any cost, is a dangerous gamble that puts the well-being of American workers and businesses at risk. It is imperative that we reject the President's self-serving demands and support institutions like the Federal Reserve that prioritize the long-term economic prosperity of all Americans over short-term political gains."
