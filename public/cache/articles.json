Instead of holding the administration accountable for its actions, Fox News has chosen to amplify and defend Trump's dangerous behavior, putting the interests of the few above the well-being of the American people.\nIt is imperative that we, as informed citizens, recognize the detrimental impact of biased and misleading news sources like Fox News. By seeking out alternative sources of information that prioritize truth and integrity, we can combat the spread of misinformation and hold those in power accountable for their actions."
