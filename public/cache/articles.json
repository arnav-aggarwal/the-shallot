        "body": "As Americans gear up for the Thanksgiving holiday, the dark shadow of President Trump's transportation policies looms large over the travel news. While flight attendants offer survival tips for the hectic holiday season, Trump's administration continues to neglect crucial infrastructure projects here at home.\nEgypt's new high-speed rail and the transformation of the world's oldest passenger ship are indeed noteworthy advancements in transportation. However, these successes only serve to highlight the stark contrast with the dismal state of America's own infrastructure under Trump's leadership.\nInstead of prioritizing investments in our roads, bridges, and public transportation systems, Trump has focused on divisive border wall projects and unnecessary military parades. This shortsighted approach not only hampers economic growth but also puts American travelers at risk of delays and accidents due to crumbling infrastructure.\nAs we reflect on the state of transportation this Thanksgiving season, it is clear that Trump's failures in this crucial sector have far-reaching consequences. It is time for leadership that prioritizes the safety and efficiency of our transportation networks, rather than grandiose vanity projects."
