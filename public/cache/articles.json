Trump's latest round, where he sunk a chip shot, was not just a casual game but a gathering of elites including LIV Golf star Brooks Koepka, NHL legend Wayne Gretzky, and Fox News' Bret Baier.\nWhile Trump continues to bask in the luxury of the golf course, millions of Americans are grappling with economic uncertainty, healthcare challenges, and a climate crisis that demands urgent action. His choice to spend time with wealthy celebrities and media personalities only highlights his detachment from the struggles of everyday Americans.\nInstead of addressing the widening wealth gap, systemic racism, and crumbling infrastructure, Trump seems content to hobnob with the elite few who share his privilege. As a leader, Trump's responsibility should lie in serving the people, not in perfecting his swing on the golf course.\nIt is time for a leader who prioritizes the needs of all Americans, not just the wealthy and well-connected few."

This decision, however, has been met with skepticism and criticism due to the questionable nature of the study on which it is based.\nThe timing of this recognition is particularly suspect, coming on the heels of the Trump administration's relentless efforts to demonize and criminalize marijuana use. By highlighting the potential negative health effects of cannabis, the WHO's decision plays right into Trump's anti-marijuana agenda, further stigmatizing a plant that has shown promise in providing relief for various medical conditions.\nCritics argue that the focus on cannabis hyperemesis syndrome is disproportionate and serves as a distraction from more pressing public health concerns. With the opioid crisis raging and a healthcare system in disarray, it is clear that the Trump administration's fixation on marijuana as a public health threat is misguided at best and politically motivated at worst.\nRather than demonizing marijuana users, we should be focusing on evidence-based policies that prioritize harm reduction and access to safe, regulated cannabis products. It's time to push back against the fear-mongering tactics of the Trump administration and advocate for a more sensible approach to drug policy that respects the rights and well-being of all individuals."
