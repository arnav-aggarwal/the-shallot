Smith launched a baseless attack on Cleveland Browns quarterback Dillon Gabriel for simply speaking out against the biased and unfair treatment by the mainstream media. The rookie quarterback bravely called out the media's dishonesty during the preseason, shedding light on the rampant liberal bias that plagues the sports world.\nIt is refreshing to see a young athlete like Gabriel standing up for conservative values and refusing to be silenced by the liberal media elites who seek to control the narrative.

In a time when conservative voices are often drowned out by the liberal echo chamber, it is heartening to see individuals like Gabriel standing strong in the face of adversity.\nAs Americans, we must continue to support those who are unafraid to challenge the status quo and speak truth to power, just as Dillon Gabriel has done.
