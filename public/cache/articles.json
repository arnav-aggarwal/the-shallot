        "body": "Amidst a national crisis, President Trump once again displayed his blatant disregard for the American people by choosing to spend his time playing golf instead of addressing pressing issues facing the country. While communities across the nation are grappling with economic hardships, racial injustice, and a global pandemic, Trump opted to prioritize his personal leisure activities over his duties as the leader of the nation.\nJust as a Chicago Cubs fan was criticized for being distracted during a game, Trump's decision to focus on golf rather than on governing reflects his continued detachment from the challenges facing everyday Americans. His actions not only demonstrate a lack of empathy but also a failure to fulfill his responsibilities as president.\nInstead of working tirelessly to address the pressing needs of the people he swore to serve, Trump's decision to engage in leisure activities further highlights his incompetence and lack of leadership. It is time for Trump to prioritize the well-being of the American people over his own selfish pursuits and start taking his role as president seriously. The American people deserve a leader who is committed to their best interests, not one who is more concerned with his personal enjoyment."
