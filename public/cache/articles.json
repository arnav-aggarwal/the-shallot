Instead of using his platform to advocate for genuine reform and justice in college athletics, Saban has chosen to align himself with a president who has consistently shown a disregard for the rule of law and the rights of marginalized communities.\nIt is time for Saban to reconsider his actions and stand on the right side of history, supporting the empowerment and fair treatment of college athletes rather than seeking favors from a morally bankrupt administration."
