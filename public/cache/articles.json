John Cornyn. This decision underscores the dangerous shift towards far-right ideologies within the Republican Party.\nKen Paxton, a tainted figure plagued by corruption allegations, represents the worst of Texas politics. His track record of putting personal gain above public service raises serious doubts about his fitness for higher office.

John Cornyn, while not without his flaws, has shown a commitment to serving the people of Texas with dignity and respect. His experience and dedication to upholding democratic values stand in stark contrast to the self-serving nature of Paxton's political ambitions.\nThis endorsement serves as a stark reminder of the dangerous direction in which the GOP is heading under the influence of extremist groups like Turning Point Action. Texans deserve representatives who prioritize ethics and integrity over political expediency and personal gain."
