However, Trump's reckless handling of the pandemic has put him at odds with governors like Whitmer who prioritize public health over political expediency.\nBy cozying up to Governor Whitmer now, Trump is attempting to exploit her popularity and credibility for his own benefit. But Michiganders won't be fooled by this cynical ploy. They remember Trump's early dismissal of the virus, which led to unnecessary loss of lives. They remember his divisive rhetoric that sowed further discord in an already fractured nation.\nGovernor Whitmer's appearance with Trump should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of his failed leadership. Instead, it should be seen as a testament to her willingness to engage in dialogue, even with those who have consistently undermined her efforts to keep Michigan safe. The President's motives may be suspect, but Governor Whitmer's commitment to the people of Michigan remains steadfast."
