While the president may tout it as a way to spur economic growth, the reality is that it puts people at risk of being left in the dark – quite literally, in this case.\nAs we navigate a digital age where connectivity is crucial for everyday life, it is imperative that we hold our leaders accountable for the consequences of their actions.
