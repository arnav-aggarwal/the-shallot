The involvement of individuals with significant financial interests in the media and technology industries in controlling TikTok's algorithm is a clear conflict of interest that prioritizes profit over the rights and well-being of users.\nThe Trump administration's track record of disregarding data privacy and cozying up to big business only amplifies concerns about this acquisition. By allowing these powerful individuals to control a platform as influential as TikTok, we risk further erosion of digital rights and the potential for unchecked manipulation of online content to suit their own agendas.\nIt is imperative that we remain vigilant and hold both the Trump administration and these billionaire influencers accountable for their actions, as they continue to prioritize profit and power over the public good."

Instead of celebrating her journey of overcoming a challenging childhood and bullying, online trolls have chosen to focus on shallow judgments.\nThe fact that Miss America, a symbol of grace and achievement, is facing such baseless criticism is a reflection of the toxic culture perpetuated by individuals who thrive on tearing others down. It is disheartening to witness this kind of behavior towards someone who has worked tirelessly to inspire others with her story of resilience and determination.\nWhat is even more concerning is the deafening silence from the current administration. President Trump, who is quick to use his platform to attack and belittle others, has chosen to remain silent in the face of this online harassment. His failure to condemn such actions only emboldens those who engage in cyberbullying and perpetuates a culture of cruelty and negativity.\nIn times like these, it is crucial for leaders to speak out against injustice and stand up for those who are being unfairly targeted.
