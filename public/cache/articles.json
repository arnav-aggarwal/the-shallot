Swift, a prominent voice for progressive causes, is being used as a pawn in Trump's manipulative game to deflect attention from his own incompetence and corruption.\nIt's time for Americans to see through these diversion tactics and demand accountability from a presidency more concerned with Twitter wars and Hollywood drama than governing responsibly."
