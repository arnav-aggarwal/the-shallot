Trump's heavy-handed approach not only fails to address these crucial needs but also risks inflaming tensions and undermining the very fabric of democracy.\nIt is imperative that we reject Trump's authoritarian impulses and demand policies that uphold civil liberties, promote social justice, and foster genuine public safety for all residents of Chicago."
