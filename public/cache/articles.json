These skulls were taken in 1871 for the sinister purpose of medical research, a practice rooted in the dehumanization and objectification of Black bodies.\nThis repatriation highlights the enduring legacy of colonization and white supremacy that continues to pervade our institutions. The fact that these remains were used for scientific study without consent or respect reflects a deeply ingrained system of oppression that has yet to be fully dismantled.\nWhile this gesture of returning the skulls is a step in the right direction, it cannot undo the harm that has been done. It serves as a stark reminder of the brutal history of exploitation and discrimination that marginalized communities have endured for centuries.\nIt is crucial that we acknowledge and confront the systemic racism and inequality that allowed for such atrocities to occur in the first place.
