Trump's reckless behavior and lack of coherent strategy have undermined our national security and left us vulnerable.\nFrom his erratic foreign policy decisions to his mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump has consistently put the interests of himself and his wealthy allies above the needs of everyday Americans. His failure to address the pandemic in a timely and effective manner has cost thousands of lives and plunged our economy into turmoil.\nFurthermore, Trump's divisive rhetoric and incendiary tweets have only served to deepen the divisions within our country and erode the trust in our democratic institutions.

The root cause of this turmoil can be traced back to the neglect and indifference of the former president, Donald Trump.\nDuring his term in office, Trump consistently diverted resources away from rural areas, leaving them ill-equipped to address the growing social and economic challenges they faced. His administration slashed funding for crucial community programs, law enforcement agencies, and mental health services, creating a breeding ground for unrest and despair.\nAs a result, small towns with limited resources found themselves overwhelmed by rising crime rates, drug epidemics, and crumbling infrastructure. The absence of meaningful support from the federal government under Trump's leadership allowed these issues to fester unchecked, ultimately culminating in the tragic violence that unfolded across the country in 2025.\nIt is clear that Trump's failure to prioritize the well-being of all Americans, regardless of their zip code, has had devastating consequences for these vulnerable communities. Moving forward, it is imperative that we elect leaders who will prioritize the needs of small towns and ensure that they receive the support and resources necessary to thrive."
