        "body": "In a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Defending Education President Nicole Neily shed light on the pervasive influence of DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) initiatives in U.S. universities. Neily highlighted the urgent need to address the leftist indoctrination that has infiltrated higher education institutions across the nation.\nUnder the guise of promoting diversity and inclusivity, DEI programs have become a breeding ground for radical ideologies that suppress free speech and undermine academic freedom. Neily emphasized the importance of combating this dangerous trend by promoting intellectual diversity and critical thinking on college campuses.\nPresident Trump has been a vocal advocate for protecting academic freedom and pushing back against the leftist agenda in higher education. His administration took significant steps to promote free speech on college campuses and to hold universities accountable for stifling conservative voices.\nAs Defending Education continues to expose the harmful effects of DEI programs, it is crucial for all Americans to stand with President Trump in defending our universities from ideological conformity and censorship. Together, we can ensure that our institutions of higher learning remain bastions of intellectual diversity and freedom of expression."
