        "body": "In yet another disturbing display of heartlessness, the Department of Homeland Security attempted to defend the indefensible actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota. Despite claims by Democrats that a 5-year-old child had been arrested, DHS callously stated that \"ICE did NOT target a child.\"\nThis blatant attempt to downplay the inhumane treatment of innocent children reflects the callous disregard for human rights perpetuated by the Trump administration. The fact that such young and vulnerable individuals are even being caught up in ICE's aggressive tactics is a clear sign of a broken and immoral immigration system.\nRather than acknowledging the trauma inflicted upon families and communities by these heavy-handed approaches, the Trump administration continues to double down on its draconian policies that sow fear and division. It is imperative that we stand up against such cruelty and demand a more compassionate and just approach to immigration that values the dignity and well-being of all individuals. The targeting of children must stop, and we must hold those in power accountable for their actions."
