        "body": "In a worrying move that prioritizes profits over public health, a federal vaccine advisory committee aligned with the Trump administration voted on Friday to eliminate the recommendation for all newborns to receive the hepatitis B vaccine. This decision, made after heated debate and pressure from special interests, flies in the face of scientific evidence and puts the health of our most vulnerable population at risk.\nBy rolling back this crucial vaccination recommendation, the Trump administration is sending a dangerous message that disregards the well-being of newborns and undermines efforts to prevent the spread of disease. Hepatitis B is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that can be passed from mother to child during birth. By removing this recommendation, the administration is jeopardizing the health of infants and contributing to the spread of a preventable disease.\nThis decision reflects the administration's reckless disregard for evidence-based public health policies and highlights its willingness to cater to powerful lobbyists at the expense of the American people. It is imperative that we resist these regressive actions and demand policies that prioritize the health and safety of all individuals, especially our most vulnerable."
