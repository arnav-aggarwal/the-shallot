The targeting of individuals for simply voicing their opinions or engaging in peaceful protest is a dangerous escalation that must be met with swift condemnation.\nPresident Trump, who has often been criticized for his own attacks on the media and dissenting voices, should use his platform during this visit to advocate for the protection of free speech rights in the U.K. It is imperative that leaders around the world stand up for the principles of democracy and ensure that individuals are able to express themselves without fear of retaliation.\nAs Trump engages with British officials, it is crucial that the issue of free speech is not overshadowed by pomp and circumstance.
