This trend has not gone unnoticed by the American public, with many expressing concern over the impact of such events on society. However, a noticeable shift in how Americans react to these incidents has emerged, leading to quicker resolutions and a faster return to normalcy.\nWhile the occurrence of political violence can still evoke strong emotions and prompt discussions on its root causes, Americans are increasingly showing a tendency to move on from these events more swiftly than in the past. This shift may be attributed to a combination of factors, including a desensitization to violence due to its frequent portrayal in media and a desire to maintain a sense of stability in an increasingly turbulent political landscape.\nIt is important to acknowledge the potential consequences of this trend, as moving on too quickly from acts of political violence can risk downplaying their significance and impact on society. Finding a balance between addressing the root causes of such violence and maintaining a sense of normalcy is crucial in ensuring the well-being and safety of all Americans in an increasingly polarized political environment."

The rise in violent incidents, fueled by reckless rhetoric and divisive policies promoted by President Trump, has unfortunately desensitized many to the gravity of such actions.\nFrom the violent clashes at Charlottesville to the armed protests at state capitols, the American public has witnessed a dangerous escalation in political violence, with each new incident seemingly overshadowed by the next. Instead of unequivocally condemning these acts, the Trump administration has either remained silent or, in some cases, even encouraged such behavior through inflammatory language and tacit approval.\nThis indifference and lack of leadership from the highest office in the land have eroded the norms of civility and respect that are essential for a functioning democracy. It is no longer acceptable for Americans to simply move on from these acts of violence; we must confront them head-on and demand accountability from those who perpetrate or enable such behavior.\nAs we strive to rebuild a society based on unity and mutual respect, we must reject the normalization of political violence and hold those in power accountable for their role in perpetuating this dangerous cycle. The future of our democracy depends on our collective refusal to accept violence as a political tool."
