        "body": "In yet another display of elitist exclusion, Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, has extended invitations to Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice for her exclusive \"Together at Christmas\" carol service. This move by Middleton, often seen as a symbol of the monarchy's rigid hierarchy, only perpetuates the division and favoritism within the royal family.\nThe timing of this invitation raises suspicions, as it comes amidst growing public scrutiny of the monarchy's outdated traditions and their disconnect from the struggles of everyday people. By selectively choosing to include Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice, Middleton is attempting to paint a facade of unity while conveniently ignoring the larger issues of inequality and privilege that plague the royal family.\nThis calculated PR move by Middleton is nothing more than a distraction from the real issues at hand. While she may try to present a picture of inclusivity, the underlying message remains clear: the royal family continues to operate on a system of entitlement and exclusion, with the Duchess herself playing a role in upholding these oppressive structures.\nAs we approach the holiday season, let us not be misled by superficial gestures of unity. True solidarity requires dismantling the systems that perpetuate inequality and working towards a more just and equitable society for all."
